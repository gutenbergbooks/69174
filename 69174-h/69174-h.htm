<h3 class="p4 h3head">TRANSLATOR’S FOREWORD</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">IN this twentieth century, the sacred books of the ancients
are undoubtedly better understood than they were
even by their contemporaries, for their authors, by the
greatness of their genius, are as much nearer to us, as they
were distant from them. At the close of the eighteenth
century, the light which came from the illimitable mind of
Fabre d’Olivet shone with solitary splendour and was destined
to be seen by only a few devoted followers. But
history shows that a great inspirer always appears at the
beginning of every great epoch, and however small the number
of his disciples, these disciples with their pupils form
the magnetic chain which, according to Plato, carries his
thought out into the world.</p>

<p>Fabre d’Olivet, born at Ganges, Bas-Languedoc, Dec. 8,
1768, was distinguished even in his own day not only for
the extent of his learning but for the rectitude of his judgment
and the sublimity of his conceptions. If one can infer
from the all too scarce records available since the calamitous
fire which destroyed so many of his valued manuscripts, he
evidently suffered keenly from the fetters of mortality, and
sought with unfailing fervour what Porphyry so aptly called
the “Olympia of the Soul.”</p>

<p>Saint Yves d’Alveydre, writing of him in <cite>La France vraie</cite>,
says, that it was in 1790, while in Germany, he received
his Pythagorean initiation, the profound imprint of which
marked all his later productions. After returning to Paris
he applied himself to philological and philosophical studies
undisturbed by the terrible revolutionary storm. In obscure
seclusion he amassed, to quote Sédir, “a disconcerting
erudition.” He became familiar with all the Semitic
tongues and dialects, the Aryan languages, and even penetrated
the secrets of the Chinese hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>It was during these ten years of retirement that he wrote
his <cite>Examinations of the Golden Verses</cite> which were not
published until 1813, with its dedication to the Section of
Literature of the Imperial Institute of France. It is known
that the <cite>Golden Verses of Pythagoras</cite> were originally transcribed
by Lysis and that it is to Hierocles we owe the version
which has come down to us. Fabre d’Olivet has
translated them into French verse, the style of which he
calls <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(eumolpique)</i>, that is, subject to measure and harmonious
cadence but free from rhyme, with alternate masculine
and feminine terminations. In the <cite>Essence and Form of
Poetry</cite> which precedes the Golden Verses, he illustrates this
melodious style, in applying it to the opening lines of some
of the well-known classics, and to others not so well-known.</p>

<p>These Golden Verses, so remarkable for their moral
elevation, present the most beautiful monument of antiquity
raised in honour of Wisdom. They formed the <i>credo</i> of the
adepts and initiates. In his recondite Examinations,
Fabre d’Olivet has drawn the metaphysical correlation of
Providence, Destiny, and the Will of Man, in which combined
action Destiny reigns over the past, the Will of Man
over the future, and Providence over the present, which,
always existing, may be called Eternal. One will find this
given at greater length in his <cite>Hermeneutic Interpretation of
the Origin of the Social State of Man and the Destiny of the
Adamic Race</cite>: admirable work of this little known theosophist,
“to give him the name he loved best to hold,” says
Pierre Leroux in <cite>De l’Humanité</cite>.</p>

<p>The inequality of human conditions, upon which depend
the social and political questions, forms one of the vital
subjects of these esoteric teachings. He has also endeavoured
to explain the true opinion of Pythagoras concerning
metempsychosis which was his sacred dogma, and said that
the dogma of transmigration of souls, received by all peoples
and revealed in the ancient mysteries, has been absolutely
disfigured in what the moderns have called metempsychosis.</p>

<p>His strange death, which occurred March 25, 1825, is
mentioned by des Essarts in <cite>Les Hiérophantes</cite>, and other
authorities including Pierre Leroux, have asserted that he
died at the foot of his altar.</p>

<p class="p2 unindent"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>:</p>

<p>Before publishing the translation of the <cite>Golden Verses
of Pythagoras</cite>, such as I have made it, in French verse which
I have designated by the
expression <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(eumolpique)</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
I would
have liked to be able to submit it to you and thus be enlightened
by your counsels or sustained by your approbation;
but academic laws and usages, whose justice I have felt,
have prevented my enjoying this advantage. The innovation,
however, which I have endeavoured to make in
French poetry and the new explanation which I have tried
to give of one of the most celebrated pieces of Greek
poetry, have seemed to me to hold too closely to your labours
and to enter too deeply into your literary provinces, for
me to believe myself able to dispense with calling your
attention to them. I crave your indulgence, if in the
demonstration of a just deference to your judgment I
involuntarily neglect certain formalities; and I beg you to
judge the purity of my intentions.</p>

<p>I claim not to be a poet; I had even long ago renounced
the art of verse, but notwithstanding that, I am now presenting
myself in the poetic career to solicit the hazardous
success of an innovation! Is it the love of glory which
inspires in me this temerity, which dazzles me today as
my autumn advances, whereas it was unable to move me
when the effervescence of my springtime ought to have
doubled its strength? No: however flattering the wreaths
that you award to talent, they would not concern me; and
if an interest, as new as powerful, had not induced me to
address you, I would keep silent. This interest, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>,
is that which science itself inspires in me, and the desire,
perhaps inconsiderate but commendable, of co-operating with
my limited ability for the development of a language whose
literary and moral influence, emerging from the bourns of
Europe and the present century, ought to invade the world
and become universal like the renown of the hero who
extends his conquests with those of the empire whose
foundations he has laid.</p>

<p>I feel, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, that I should explain my thought.
My assertion, well founded as it may be, appears none the
less extraordinary, and I am bound to admit this. The
disfavour which is attached to all new ideas, to all innovations,
the just defiance that they inspire, the element of
ridicule that springs from their downfall, would have arrested
my audacity, if I had had audacity alone, and if the
worthy ambition of effecting a general good had not raised
me above a particular evil which might have resulted for me.
Besides I have counted upon the judicious good-will of the
two illustrious Academies to which I am addressing myself:
I have thought that they would distinguish in the verse
which I am presenting for their examination, both as a
means of execution in French poetry and as a means of
translation in ancient and foreign poetry, the real utility
that they can offer, of the fortuitous beauty which they
lack, and which a more capable hand would have been able
to give them; I flatter myself, at length, that they would
grant to the end, without prejudice, the attention which is
necessary, and that if they refused an entire approbation to
my efforts, they would at least render justice to my zeal and
commend the motives which have made me attempt them.
<!--Page 020--></p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section One">§ I</abbr></p>

<p>When, after the revival of letters in Europe, Chancellor
Bacon, legislator of thought, sketched with bold strokes the
tree of human knowledge, and brought back each branch
of science to that of the moral faculties upon which it depends,
he did not fail to observe sagaciously that it was
necessary to distinguish in poetry two things, its essence
and its form<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>:
its essence as pertaining wholly to the imagination,
and composing by itself alone one of the principal
branches of science<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>;
its form, as making part of the grammar,
and entering thus into the domain of philosophy and
into the rational faculty of the
understanding.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
This
celebrated man had borrowed this idea from a man much
older and more celebrated than himself, Plato. According
to this admirable philosopher, poetry is either a simple
talent, an art which one uses to give to his own ideas a
particular form, or it is a divine inspiration by means of
which one clothes in the human language and transmits
to men the ideas of the
gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
It is because, never having
felt sufficiently this important distinction and having confused
two ideas that ought to be separated, the essence and
the form of poetry, which are as the soul and body of this
science, that so many men among the modern nations proclaimed
themselves poets, whereas they were, in strict truth,
only clever versifiers. For it does not suffice, as Plato
again said, to have poetic talent, it does not suffice to make
verse and even good verse, to be called a
poet<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>;
it is necessary
to possess that divine enthusiasm, that inspiration
which elevates the soul, enlightens it, transports it, as it
were, to intellectual regions and causes it to draw from its
source the very essence of this science.</p>

<p>How they delude themselves, those who, habitually
deceived, foolishly imagine that the lofty fame of Orpheus,
Homer, Pindar, Æschylus, or Sophocles and the immortality
which they enjoy, belongs only to the plan of their works,
to the harmony of their verse, and to the happy use of their
talent! These flattering appearances which constitute the
form of their poetry would have disappeared long ago, they
would have become broken, like fragile vases, upon the torrent
of centuries, if the intelligence which animated them
had not eternalized their duration. But this secret intelligence
does not reside, as certain other superficial readers
persuade themselves, being still deceived, in the simple
interest that the characters <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(mise en scène)</i> inspire; this interest,
which results from their contrast and from the shock
of the passions, is another sort of form, more hidden, and
less frail, than the former, it is true, but as variable generally
and subject to the great revolution of customs, laws, and
usages. True poetry does not depend upon that; it depends
upon the primordial ideas which the genius of the poet in
his exaltation has seized in the intellectual nature, and
which his talent has shown afterwards in the elementary
nature, thus adapting the simulacra of physical things to
the movement inspired by the soul, instead of adapting
this movement to those same simulacra, as those who
write history. This is what Bacon, the modern philosopher
whom I have already cited, has felt so
perfectly.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
He says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">As the sentient world is inferior to the human soul, it is for
poetry to give to this nature what reality has refused it, lending
to it the faculties of the intellectual world; and as the acts and
events which make the subject of true history have not that
grandeur and that sublimity for which the human soul seeks,
it is necessary that poetry create acts and events greater and
more heroic. All must be increased and embellished by its
voice and receive from it a new existence; it is necessary even
that virtue shine with an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i> more pure; that the veil which
covers truth be lifted from its eyes and that the course of Providence,
better discerned, be allowed to penetrate into the most
secret causes of events.</p>

<p class="p2">The philosopher who expressed thus his thought regarding
the essence of poetry, was far from believing, as the vulgar
have always believed, and as certain modern writers
have wished to convince the
savants,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span>
that, of the two parts
of poetry, the positive form might be the only genuine;
that is to say, that they do not by any means consider that
the human characters put upon the stage by the poets
whom I have just named, were historic characters. Bacon
understood well that Achilles, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Castor
and Pollux, Helen, Iphigenia, Œdipus, Phædra, etc., are
somewhat more than they appear to be, and that their
virtues or their vices, their heroic actions, even their crimes,
celebrated by poetry, contain a profound meaning wherein
lie buried the mysteries of religion and the secrets of
philosophy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>It belongs only to the men to whom poetry is known by
its exterior forms alone and who have never penetrated as
far as its essence, to imagine that a small city of Asia, unknown
to all Asia, around which the King of kings of Greece
waited in vain for ten years to avenge the honour of his
brother betrayed by his wife, should be able during three
thousand years to occupy the greatest minds of Europe,
on account of a quarrel which was raised in the tenth year
of the siege, between this King of kings and a petty prince
of his army, angry and sulky, named Achilles. It is only
permitted to the phlegmatic chronologists, whom the muses
have never visited in their studies, to seek seriously to fix
the year and the day when this quarrel took place. A man,
strongly imbued with the spirit of Homer or of Sophocles,
would never see in Ulysses a real man, a king who, returning
to his isle after long wanderings, kills in cold blood a
crowd of lovers of his wife and rests confident of the conjugal
fidelity of that spouse abandoned for twenty years,
and whom he had won in the
course,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
although, according
to the most common reports, she was delivered of a son in
his absence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>;
nor in Œdipus, another king, who, without
knowing it, without wishing it, always innocent, kills his
father, espouses his mother and, driven to parricide and
incest by an irresistible destiny, tears out his eyes and condemns
himself to wander over the earth, to be a frightful
example of celestial wrath. The platitudes and ridicule
of the deed related by Homer, and the horror which resulted
from that presented on the stage by Sophocles, are sufficient
evidence against their reality. If the poem of the one and
the tragedy of the other do not conceal, under the coarse
exterior which covers them, a secret fire which acts unknown
to the reader, never would a sane man tolerate a presentation,
on the one side, of vice changed into virtue, and on the
other, virtue changed into vice, and the gods operating this
strange metamorphosis against all the laws of natural
justice. He would throw aside the book with disgust, or,
agreeing with the judicious reflection of an ancient Greek
writer, exclaim with
him<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>:
</p>

<p class="blockquote">If Homer had merely thought with respect to the gods what
he said, he would have been an impious, sacrilegious man, a
veritable Salmoneus, a second Tantalus; but let us guard against
doing him this wrong, or taking for guides those who, misunderstanding
the allegorical genius of this great poet, and hesitating
before the outer court of his mysterious poetry, have never succeeded
in understanding the sublime philosophy which is enclosed
therein.</p>

<p class="p2">You are not, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, of those designated by Heraclides
in the words I have just quoted. Members of these celebrated
Academies where Homer and Sophocles have found
so many admirers, defenders, and illustrious disciples, you
can easily admit that I see in these great men more than
ordinary poets, that I place their glory elsewhere than in
their talent, and that I say, particularly of Homer, that
his most just claims to immortality are less in the form than
in the essence of his poetry, because a form, however admirable
it may be, passes and yields to time which destroys it,
whereas the essence or the spirit which animates it, immutable
as the Divinity from which it emanates by inspiration,
resists all vicissitudes and seems to increase in vigour and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i>, in proportion as the centuries passing away reveal its
force and serve as evidence of its celestial origin. I flatter
myself that my sentiments in this regard are not foreign
to yours and that the successors of Corneille, Racine, and
Boileau hear with pleasure these eulogies given to the creator
of epopœia, to the founders of dramatic art, and agree with
me in regarding them as particular organs of the Divinity,
the instruments chosen for the instruction and civilization
of men.</p>

<p>If you deign, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, to follow the development of
my ideas with as much attention as indulgence, you already
know that what I call the essence or spirit of poetry, and
which, following upon the steps of the founder of the
Academy and of the regenerator of the sciences of Europe, I
distinguish from its form, is no other thing than the allegorical
genius, immediate production of the inspiration; you
also understand that I mean by inspiration, the infusion
of this same genius into the soul which, having power only
in the intellectual nature, is manifested in action by passing
into the elementary nature by means of the inner labour of
the poet who invests it with a sentient form according to
his talent; you perceive finally, how, following this simple
theory, I explain the words of Plato, and how I conceive
that the inspired poet transmits to men the ideas of the gods.
I have no need I think of telling you that I make an enormous
difference between this divine inspiration which exalts
the soul and fills it with a real enthusiasm, and that sort
of inner movement or disorder which the vulgar also call
inspiration, which in its greatest perfection is only passion excited
by the love of glory, united with a habit of verse making,
which constitutes the talent, and in its imperfection is only
a disordered passion called by Boileau, an ardour for rhyming.
These two kinds of inspiration in no wise resemble
each other; their effects are as different as their causes,
their productions as different as their sources. The one,
issuing from the intellectual nature, has its immutability:
it is the same in all time, among all peoples, and in the heart
of all men who receive it; it alone produces genius: its first
manifestation is very rare, but its second manifestation is
less so, as I will show later on. The other inspiration, inherent
in sentient nature, born of passion, varies with the
whim of men and things, and takes on the hue of the customs
and the times; it can bring forth talent or at least modify
it, and when it is seconded by a great facility, can go to the
extent of feigning genius but never farther: its real domain
is the mind. Its possession is not very rare even in its
perfection. One can sometimes find it united with the true
inspiration, first as in Homer, or second as in Vergil; and
then the form which it unceasingly works over, joining its
sentient beauties to the intellectual beauties of genius,
creates the monuments of science.</p>

<p>It may be that the development which I have just given
of my ideas on the essence of poetry will appear new, although
I must acknowledge that in reality they are not.
I am addressing men who are too enlightened to ignore what
the ancients have said in this respect. Heraclides, whom
I have already cited, is not the only one who has given this
impression. Strabo assures positively that ancient poetry
was only the language of allegory,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
and he refutes Eratosthenes
who pretended that the aim of Homer was only to
amuse and please. In this he is in accord with Denys of
Halicarnassus who avows that the mysteries of nature and
the most sublime conceptions of morals have been covered
with the veil of
allegory.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
Phurnutus goes farther: he
declares that the allegories used by Hesiod and by Homer
do not differ from those which other foreign poets have used
before them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
Damascius said as much of the poems of
Orpheus,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
and Plutarch confirms it in a passage which has
been preserved to us by Eusebius.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first ages of Greece, poetry, consecrated to the
service of the altars, left the enclosures of the temples only
for the instruction of the people: it was as a sacred language
in which the priests, entrusted with presiding at the mysteries
of religion, interpreted the will of the gods. The
oracles, dogmas, moral precepts, religious and civil laws,
teachings of all sorts concerning the labours of the body, the
operations of the mind, in fact all that which was regarded
as an emanation, an order, or a favour from the Divinity,
all was written in verse. To this sacred language was
given the name <i>Poetry</i>, that is to say, the Language of the
Gods: a symbolic name which accords with it perfectly,
since it expressed at the same time its origin and
its usage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>

It was said to have come from
Thrace,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
and the one who had
invented it and caused its first accents to be heard was
called Olen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
Now these are again two symbolic names
perfectly adapted to the idea that one had of this divine
science: it was descended from <i>Thrace</i>, that is to say, from
the Ethereal Space; it was <i>Olen</i> who had invented it, that
is to say, the Universal
Being.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
To understand these three
etymologies which can be regarded as the fundamental
points of the history of poetry, it is necessary to remember,
first, that the Phœnicians, at the epoch when they covered
not only Greece but the coasts of the rest of Europe with
their colonies, brought there their language, and gave their
names to the countries of which they had taken possession;
secondly, that these names drawn almost always from objects
symbolic of their cult, constituted for these countries
a sort of sacred geography, which Greece above all others,
was faithful in
preserving.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
It was thus (for there is nothing
under the sun which cannot find either its model or its copy)
when the Europeans took possession of America and colonized
it, and carried to those regions their diverse dialects
and covered it with names drawn from the mysteries of
Christianity. One ought therefore, when one wishes to understand
the ancient names of the countries of Greece, those of
their heroic personages, those of the mysterious subjects of
their cult, to have recourse to the Phœnician dialect which
although lost to us can easily be restored with the aid of
Hebrew, Aramaic, Chaldean, Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic.</p>

<p>I do not intend, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, to fatigue you with proofs of
these etymologies which are not in reality the subject of
my discourse. I am content to place them on the margin
for the satisfaction of the curious. Thus I shall make use
of them later, when occasion demands. But to return to
Thrace, this country was always considered by the Greeks
as the place peculiar to their gods and the centre of their
cult; the divine country, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>. All the names that
it has borne in different dialects and which in the course
of time have become concentrated in particular regions,
have been synonyms of theirs. Thus, Getæ, Mœsia, Dacia,
all signify the country of the
gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
Strabo, in speaking
of the Getæ, said that these peoples recognized a sovereign
pontiff to whom they gave the title of God, the dignity of
which existed still in his
time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
This sovereign pontiff
resided upon a mountain that d’Anville believes he has
recognized, between Moldavia and Transylvania. The
Thracians had also a sovereign pontiff instituted in the
same manner as that of the Getæ, and residing likewise
upon a sacred
mountain.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
It was, no doubt, from the
heights of these mountains that the divine oracles, the laws
and teachings which the great pontiffs had composed in
verse, were at first spread throughout Greece; so that it
might be said, literally as well as figuratively, that poetry,
revered as the language of the gods, production of an Eternal
Being, descended from the ethereal abode and was propagated
upon earth for the instruction and delight of mortals.
It appears to me very certain that the temple of Delphi,
erected upon the famous mountain of Parnassus, differed
not essentially at first from those of Thrace; and what
confirms me in this idea is that, according to an ancient
tradition, it was Olen who, coming out from Lycia, that is
to say from the light, caused all Greece to recognize the
cult of Apollo and Diana; composed the hymns which were
chanted at Delos in honour of these two divinities and established
the temple of Delphi of which he was the first pontiff.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>

Thus the temple of Delphi rivalled those of Thrace. Its
foundation, doubtless due to some innovator priest, was
attributed by a poetic metaphor to the divinity which had
inspired it. At that time a schism arose and two cults
were formed, that of the Thracians consecrated to Bacchus
and Ceres, or Dionysus the divine spirit, and Demeter the
earth-mother<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>;
and that of the Greeks, properly speaking,
consecrated to the sun and the moon, adored under the
names of Apollo and Diana. It is to this schism that one
should ascribe the famous dispute which was raised, it is
said, between Bacchus and Apollo concerning the possession
of the tripod of
Delphi.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
The poetic fable woven from this
subject was made to preserve the remembrance of the
moral incident and not of the physical event; for at this
remote epoch, when verse only was written, history, ever
allegorical, treated only of moral and providential matters,
disdaining all physical details deemed little worthy of
occupying the memory of men.</p>

<p>However that may be, it appears certain, notwithstanding
this schism, that the cult of the Thracians dominated Greece
for a long time. The new source of poetry opened at Delphi
and on Mount Parnassus, destined in time to become so
celebrated, remained at first somewhat unknown. It is
worthy of observation that Hesiod, born in the village of
Ascra, a short distance from Delphi, makes no mention
either of the oracle or of the temple of Apollo. All that he
said of this city, which he named Pytho, has reference to
the stone which Saturn had swallowed, believing to devour
his son.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
Homer does not mention this Pytho in the <cite>Iliad</cite>;
he mentions in the <cite>Odyssey</cite> an oracle delivered by Apollo
upon Parnassus. For a long time, the peoples of Greece,
accustomed to receive from the ancient mountains of Thrace
both their oracles and their instructions, turned toward
that country and neglected the new sacred mount. This
is why the most ancient traditions place in Thrace,
with the supremacy of cult and sacerdotalism, the cradle
of the most famous poets and that of the Muses who
had inspired them: Orpheus, Musæus, Thamyris, and
Eumolpus were Thracians. Pieria, where the Muses
were born, was a mountain of Thrace; and when, at
length, it was a question of rendering to the gods a severe
and orthodox cult, it was said that it was necessary to
imitate the Thracians, or, as one would say in French,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">thraciser</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides it must be observed, that at the epoch when
the temple of Delphi was founded, the new cult, presented
to the Greeks under the name of the universal Olen, tended
to unite Apollo and Diana, or the sun and the moon, under
the same symbolic figure, and to make of it only one
and the same object of adoration, under the name of <cite>Œtolinos</cite>,
that is to say,
<i>Sun-moon</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
It was proclaimed that
the middle of the earth, its paternal and maternal umbilicus,
was found placed exactly on the spot where the new sacred
city was built, which was called for this mystical reason
Delphi.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
But it seems that the universality of this Œtolinos
was never well understood by the Greeks, who, in their
minds, united only with difficulty that which custom and
their senses had taught them to separate. Moreover one
can well conjecture that, as in all religious schisms, a host
of difficulties and contradictory opinions were raised. If
I can believe the sacerdotal traditions of India, that I encounter,
the greatest difficulty was, not knowing which
sex dominated in this mysterious being whose essence was
composed of the sun and moon and whose hermaphroditic
umbilicus was possessed in Delphi. This insoluble question
had more than once divided mankind and stained the earth
with blood. But here is not the place to touch upon one of
the most important and most singular facts of the history
of man. I have already deviated too much from my subject,
and I return to it asking pardon of my judges for this
necessary digression.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="section Two">§ II</abbr></p>

<p>Poetry, transported with the seat of religion from the
mountains of Thrace to those of Phocis, lost there, as
did religion, its primitive unity. Not only did each sovereign
pontiff use it to spread his dogmas, but the opposed
sects born of the rending of the cult, vying with each other,
took possession of it. These sects, quite numerous, personified
by the allegorical genius which presided over poetry,
and which, as I have said, constituted its essence, were
confused with the mind which animated them and were
considered as a particular being. Thence, so many of the
demi-gods, and the celebrated heroes, from whom the Greek
tribes pretended to have descended; thence, so many of
the famous poets to whom were attributed a mass of works
that emanated from the same sanctuary, or were composed
for the support of the same doctrine. For it is well to
remember that the allegorical history of these remote times,
written in a different spirit from the positive history which
has succeeded it, resembled it in no way, and that it is in
having confused them that so many grave errors have arisen.
It is a very important observation that I again make here.
This history, confided to the memory of men or preserved
among the sacerdotal archives of the temples in detached
fragments of poetry, considered things only from the moral
side, was never occupied with individuals, but saw only the
masses; that is to say, peoples, corporations, sects, doctrines,
even arts and sciences, as so many particular beings that
it designated by a generic name. It is not that these masses
were unable to have a chief to direct their movements, but
this chief, regarded as the instrument of a certain mind,
was neglected by history which attached itself to the mind
only. One chief succeeded another without allegorical
history making the least mention of it. The adventures
of all were accumulated upon the head of one alone. It
was the moral thing whose course was examined, whose
birth, progress, or downfall was described. The succession
of things replaced that of individuals. Positive history,
which ours has become, follows a method entirely different.
The individuals are everything for it: it notes with scrupulous
exactitude dates and facts which the other scorns.
I do not pronounce upon their common merit. The moderns
would mock that allegorical manner of the ancients, if they
could believe it possible, as I am persuaded the ancients
would have mocked the method of the moderns, had they
been able to foresee its possibility in the future. How
approve of what is unknown? Man approves of only what
he likes; he always believes he knows all that he ought to
like.</p>

<p>I can say, after having repeated this observation, that
the poet Linus, who is regarded as the author of all the
melancholy chants of the ancient world, represents nothing
less than lunar poetry detached from the doctrine of Œtolinos,
of which I have spoken, and considered as schismatic
by the Thracians; I can also say, that the poet Amphion,
whose chants were, on the contrary, so powerful and so
virile, typifies the orthodox solar poetry, opposed by these
same Thracians; whereas the prophet Thamyris, who, it is
said, celebrated in such stately verse the creation of the
world and the war of the
Titans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span>
represents quite plainly
the universal doctrine of Olen, re-established by his followers.
The name of Amphion signifies the orthodox or
national voice of Greece; that of Thamyris, the twin lights
of the gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
One feels, accordingly, that the evils which
came to Linus and to Thamyris, one of whom was killed by
Hercules,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
and the other deprived of sight by the
Muses,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>

are, in reality, only some sort of criticism or unfortunate
incident sustained by the doctrines which they represented,
on account of the opposition of the Thracians. What I
have said concerning Linus, Amphion, and Thamyris, can
be applied to the greater part of the poets who preceded
Homer, and Fabricius names seventy of
these<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>;
one could
also extend it to Orpheus, but only on a certain side; for
although it may be very true, that no positive detail is
possessed regarding the character of the celebrated man,
founder or propagator of the doctrine which has borne this
name; although it may be very true, that all that concerns
his birth, his life, and his death is completely unknown, it
is none the less certain that this man has existed, that he has
been actually the head of a very extended sect, and that the
allegorical fables which remain to us on this subject depict,
more particularly than they have done with any
other, the course of his thoughts and the success of his
institutions.</p>

<p>Orpheus belongs, on the one side, to anterior times, and
on the other, to times merely ancient. The epoch when he
appeared is the line of demarcation between pure allegory
and mixed allegory, the intelligible and the sentient. He
taught how to ally the rational faculty with the imaginative
faculty. The science which was a long time after
called <i>philosophy</i>, originated with him. He laid its first
basis.</p>

<p>One should guard against believing, following in the
footsteps of certain historians deceived by the meaning of
allegorical fables, that when Orpheus appeared, Greece,
still barbarous, offered only the traces of a civilization hardly
outlined, or that the ferocious animals, tamed by the charm
of his poetry, should represent, in effect, the inhabitants of
this beautiful country. Men capable of receiving a cult
so brilliant as that of Orpheus, a doctrine so pure, and
mysteries so profound; men who possessed a language so
formed, so noble, so harmonious as that which served that
inspired man to compose his hymns, were far from being
ignorant and savage to this degree. It is not true, as has
been said and repeated without examination, that poetry
had its birth in the forests, in regions rough and wild, nor
above all, that it may be the concomitant of the infancy
of the nations and the first stammerings of the human mind.
Poetry, on the contrary, having attained its perfection, indicates
always a long existence among the peoples, a civilization
very advanced and all the splendour of a virile age.
The sanctuary of the temple is its true cradle. Glance
over the savage world and see if the Iroquois or the Samoyeds
have a poetry. Have the peoples who were found in their
infancy in the isles of the Pacific shown you hymns like
those of Orpheus, epic monuments like the poems of Homer?
Is it not known that the Tartars who have subjugated
Asia, those proud Manchus who today reign over China,
have never been able to derive from their language, rebellious
to all kinds of melody and rhythm, a single
verse,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>

although since their conquests they have felt and appreciated
the charms of this
art?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Bears and lions, tamed and brought nearer together by
Orphic poetry, have no reference to men, but to things:
they are the symbols of rival sects which, imbibing their
hatred at the very foot of the altars, diffused it over all
that surrounded them and filled Greece with troubles.</p>

<p>For a long time this country was a prey to the double
scourge of religious and political anarchy. In detaching
herself from the cult of the metropolis, she also detached
herself from its government. Once a colony of the Phœnicians,
she had thrown off their yoke, not however spontaneously
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(en masse)</i>, but gradually, over and over again;
so that there were twenty rival temples, twenty rival cities,
twenty petty peoples divided by rite, by civil interest, and
by the ambition of the priests and princes who governed
them. The Thracians, remaining faithful to the ancient
laws, were styled superstitious or enslaved, whereas the
innovators and the insurgents were considered, by the
Thracians and often by themselves, schismatics and rebels.
Phœnicia had vainly wished to oppose this general desertion.
Asia came to experience the most terrible shocks.
India, which had long held the sceptre there, was buried
for fifteen hundred years in her <i>Kali-youg</i>, or her age of
darkness, and offered only the shadow of her ancient
splendour.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>

For fifteen centuries she had lost her unity by the
extinction of her imperial dynasties. Many rival kingdoms
were formed,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
whose constant quarrels had left them
neither the leisure nor the possibility of watching over and
supporting their colonies from afar. The gradual lowering
of the Mediterranean, and the alluvial deposit of the shores
of Egypt raising the Isthmus of
Suez,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
had cut off all communication
between this sea and the Red Sea, and, by barriers
difficult to surmount, separated the primitive Phœnicians,
established upon the shores of the Indian Ocean, from those
of Palestine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
The meridional Arabs were separated from
the septentrional, and both had broken with the Indians
to whom they had formerly
belonged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>
Tibet had adopted
a particular cult and form of
government.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
Persia had
been subject to the empire of the
Assyrians.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
At last the
political ties which united all these states, and which once
formed only a vast group under the domination of the
Indian monarchs, had become relaxed or broken on all
sides. Egypt, long subject to the Philistines, known under
the name of Shepherds, came at length to drive them out,
and emerging from her lethargy prepared herself to seize
the influence which Asia had allowed to
escape.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
Already
the most warlike of her kings, Sethos, had extended his
empire over both Libya and Arabia; Phœnicia and Assyria
had been subjugated; he had entered triumphant into
Babylon and was seated upon the throne of
Belus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
He
would not have hesitated to attempt the conquest of Greece,
if he had been able as easily to lead his army there; but it
was difficult for him to create a marine force, and above
all to overcome the invincible repugnance that the Egyptians
had for the sea.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
Obliged to employ the Phœnicians,
his ancient enemies, he was able to draw from them only
mediocre service. In spite of these obstacles and the stubborn
resistance of the Greeks, he succeeded nevertheless
in making some conquests and forming some partial settlements.
Athens, so celebrated later, was one of the principal
ones.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>These events, these revolutions, calamitous in appearance,
were in reality to produce great benefits. Greece, already
impregnated with the learning of the Phœnicians,
which she had obtained and elaborated, afterward received
that of the Egyptians and elaborated it still further. A man
born in the heart of Thrace, but carried in his childhood
into Egypt through the desire for
knowledge,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span>
returned to
his country with one of the Egyptian colonies, to kindle
there the new light. He was initiated into all the mysteries
of religion and science: he surpassed, said Pausanias, all
those who had preceded him, by the beauty of his verse,
the sublimity of his chants, and the profoundness of his
knowledge in the art of healing and of appeasing the
gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>

This was Orpheus: he took this name from that of his
doctrine<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>

which aimed to cure and to save by knowledge.</p>

<p>I should greatly overstep the limits that I have prescribed
for this discourse if I should recall in detail all that
Greece owed to this celebrated man. The mythological
tradition has consecrated in a brilliant allegory the efforts
which he made to restore to men the truth which they
had lost. His love for Eurydice, so much sung by the
poets, is but the symbol of the divine science for which he
longed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>
The name of this mysterious spouse, whom he
vainly wished to return to the light, signified only the doctrine
of the true science, the teaching of what is beautiful
and veritable, by which he tried to enrich the earth. But
man cannot look upon the face of truth before attaining the
intellectual light, without losing it; if he dare to contemplate
it in the darkness of his reason, it vanishes. This is
what the fable, which everyone knows, of Eurydice, found
and lost, signifies.</p>

<p>Orpheus, who felt by his own experience, perhaps, the
great disadvantage that he had here, of presenting the
truth to men before they might be in condition to receive
it, instituted the divine mysteries; an admirable school
where the initiate, conducted from one degree to another,
slowly prepared and tried, received the share of light in
proportion to the strength of his intelligence, and gently
enlightened, without risk of being dazzled, attained to
virtue, wisdom, and truth. There has been but one opinion
in antiquity concerning the utility of the mysteries,
before dissolution had stained its precincts and corrupted
its aim. All the sages, even Socrates, have praised this
institution,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span>
the honour of which has been constantly attributed
to Orpheus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
It is not improbable that this sage
had found the model in Egypt and that he himself had been
initiated, as
Moses<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span>
and Pythagoras<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span>
had been before and
after him; but in this case an imitation was equivalent to
a creation.</p>

<p>I have said that after the appearance of Orpheus, poetry
had lost its unity: as divided as the cult, it had sustained
its vicissitudes. Entirely theosophical in its principle, and
calm as the Divinity which inspired it, it had taken in the
midst of the opposed sects a passionate character which
it had not had previously. The priests, who used it to
uphold their opinions, had found, instead of the real inspiration,
that sort of physical exaltation which results from the
fire of passions, whose movement and fleeting splendour
entrance the vulgar. Vying with each other they had
brought forth a mass of theological systems, had multiplied
the allegorical fables concerning the universe, and had
drowned, as it were, the unity of the Divinity in the vain
and minute distinction of its infinite faculties; and as each
composed in his own dialect and in pursuance of his own
caprice, each devised unceasingly new names for the same
beings, according as they believed they caught a glimpse of
a certain new virtue in these beings that another had not
expressed, it came to pass that not only were the gods multiplied
by the distinction of their faculties, but still more by
the diversity of names employed in expressing them. Very
soon there was not a city nor a town in Greece, that did not
have, or at least believed that it had, its own particular
god. If one had carefully examined this prodigious number
of divinities, one would have clearly seen that they
could be reduced, by elimination, to a small number and
would finally end by being mingled in a sole Universal
Being; but that was very difficult for people, flattered, moreover,
by a system which compared the condition of the gods
with theirs, and offered them thus, protectors and patrons
so much the more accessible as they were less occupied
and less powerful.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
Vainly, therefore, the Egyptian colony
established at Athens presented to the adoration of this
people imbued with the prejudice of polytheism, the sovereign
of the gods under the title of the
Most-High<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>;
the
veneration of this people was turned wholly towards Minerva,
who became its patron under the name of
Athena,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>

as Juno was that of Argos,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>
Ceres, that of Eleusis, Phigalia,
Methydrium,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>
etc.</p>

<p>Orpheus, instructed as was Moses, in the sanctuaries of
Egypt, had the same ideas as the legislator of the Hebrews
upon the unity of God, but the different circumstances in
which he found himself placed did not permit him to divulge
this dogma; he reserved this for making it the basis of his
mysteries, and continued, in the meantime, to personify in
his poetry the attributes of the Divinity. His institutions,
drawn from the same source, founded upon the same truths,
received the imprint of his character and that of the people
to whom he had destined them. As those of Moses were
severe and, if one must admit, harsh in form, enemies of the
sciences and arts, so those of Orpheus were brilliant, fitted
to seduce the minds, favourable to all the developments
of the imagination. It was beneath the allurements of
pleasure, of joy, and of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(fêtes)</i>, that he concealed the utility
of his lessons and the depth of his doctrine. Nothing was
more full of pomp than the celebration of its mysteries.
Whatever majesty, force, and grace, poetry, music, and
painting had, was used to excite the enthusiasm of the
initiate.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span>
He found no pretext advantageous enough, no
form beautiful enough, no charm powerful enough to interest
the hearts and attract them toward the sublime truths
which he proclaimed. These truths, whose force the early
Christians have recognized,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span>
went much further than those
of which Moses had been the interpreter; they seemed to
anticipate the times. Not only did he teach of the unity
of God,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
and give the most sublime ideas of this unfathomable
Being<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span>;
not only did he explain the birth of the Universe
and the origin of things<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>;
but he represented this unique
God under the emblem of a mysterious Trinity endowed
with three names<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>;
he spoke of the dogma which Plato
announced a long time after concerning the Logos, or the
Divine Word; and, according to Macrobius, taught even its
incarnation or its union with matter, its death or its division
in the world of sense, its resurrection or its transfiguration,
and finally its return to the original
Unity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>This inspired man, by exalting in Man the imagination,
that admirable faculty which makes the charm of life, fettered
the passions which trouble its serenity. Through
him his disciples enjoyed the enthusiasm of the fine arts
and he insisted that their customs should be pure and
simple.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>

The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(régime)</i> that he prescribed for them was that which
Pythagoras introduced
later<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>. One of the most pleasing
rewards which he offered to their endeavours, the very aim
of their initiation into his mysteries, was, putting themselves
in communion with the gods<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span>;
freeing themselves
from the cycle of generations, purifying their soul, and rendering
it worthy of projecting itself, after the downfall of its
corporal covering toward its primal abode, to the realms
of light and happiness.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite my resolution to be brief, I cannot resist the
pleasure of speaking at greater length of Orpheus, and of
recalling, as is my custom, things which, appearing today
wholly foreign to my subject, nevertheless, when examined
from my viewpoint, belong to it. Poetry was not at all in
its origin what it became later, a simple accomplishment,
regarded by those who profess to be savants as even rather
frivolous<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>;
it was the language of the gods, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(par excellence)</i>,
that of the prophets, the ministers of the altars, the preceptors
and the legislators of the world. I rejoice to repeat
this truth, after rendering homage to Orpheus, to this
admirable man, to whom Europe owes the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i> with which
she has shone and with which she will shine a long time.
Orpheus has been the real creator of poetry and of
music,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span>
the father of mythology, of morals, and of philosophy: it is
he who has served as model for Hesiod and Homer, who has
illumined the footsteps of Pythagoras and Plato.</p>

<p>After having wisely accommodated the outward ceremonies
to the minds of the people whom he wished to instruct,
Orpheus divided his doctrine into two parts, the one
vulgar, and the other mysterious and secret, following in
this the method of the Egyptians, whose disciple he had
been<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span>;
then, turning his attention to poetry, and seeing
into what chaos this science had fallen and the confusion
that had been made of divine and profane things, he judiciously
separated it into two principal branches, which he
assigned, the one to theology, the other to natural philosophy.
It can be said that he gave in each the precept
and the example. As sublime a theosophist as he was
profound as a philosopher, he composed an immense quantity
of theosophical and philosophical verses upon all sorts
of subjects. Time has destroyed nearly all of them; but
their memory has been perpetuated. Among the works
of Orpheus that were cited by the ancients and whose loss
must be deplored, were found, on the subject of theosophy,
<cite>The Holy Word</cite> or <cite>The Sacred
Logos</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span>
by which Pythagoras
and Plato profited much; the <cite>Theogony</cite>, which preceded that
of Hesiod more than five centuries; <cite>The Initiations to the
Mysteries of the Mother of the
Gods</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
and <cite>The Ritual of the
Sacrifices</cite>, wherein he had recorded, undoubtedly, the divers
parts of his doctrine<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>:
on the subject of philosophy, a celebrated
cosmogony was found,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
in which an astronomical
system was developed that would be an honour to our
century, touching the plurality of the worlds, the station of
the sun at the centre of the universe, and the habitation of
the stars.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span>
These extraordinary works emanated from the
same genius who had written in verse upon grammar, music,
natural history, upon the antiquities of the many isles of
Greece, upon the interpretation of signs and prodigies, and
a mass of other subjects, the details of which one can see
in the commencement of the Argonautica of Onomacritus,
which is attributed to him.</p>

<p>But at the same time that Orpheus opened thus to his
successor two very distinct careers, theosophical and philosophical,
he did not entirely neglect the other parts of this
science: his hymns and his odes assigned him to a distinguished
rank among the lyric poets; his <cite>Démétréïde</cite> presaged
the beauties of Epopœia, and the representations full of
pomp, that he introduced into his mysteries, gave birth to
Greek Melopœia whence sprang dramatic art. He can
therefore be regarded, not only as the precursor of Hesiod
and Epimenides, but even as that of Homer, Æschylus, and
Pindar. I do not pretend, in saying this, to take away
anything from the glory of these celebrated men: the one
who indicates a course, yields to the one who executes it:
now this, especially, is what Homer did.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Three">§ III</abbr></p>

<p>Homer was not the first epic poet in the order of time,
but in the order of things. Before him many poets
were skilled in Epopœia; but no one had known the nature
of this kind of poetry<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span>;
no one had united the opposed qualities
which were necessary. There existed at this epoch a
multitude of allegorical fables which had emanated at
divers times from different sanctuaries. These fables,
committed at first to memory, had been collected in several
sets of works which were called
cycles.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span>
There were allegorical,
mythological, and epic
cycles.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>
We know from
certain precious texts of the ancients, that these sorts of
collections opened generally with the description of Chaos,
with the marriage of Heaven and Earth; contained the
genealogy of the Gods and the combats of the Giants;
included the expedition of the Argonauts, the famous wars
of Thebes and of Troy; extended as far as the arrival of
Ulysses at Ithaca, and terminated with the death of this
hero, caused by his son
Telegonus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>
The poets who, before
Homer, had drawn from these cycles the subject of their
works, not having penetrated as far as the allegorical sense,
lacking inspiration, or being found incapable of rendering
it, lacking talent, had produced only cold inanimate copies,
deprived of movement and grace. They had not, however,
omitted any of the exploits of Hercules or of Theseus, nor
any of the incidents of the sieges of Thebes or Troy; and
their muse, quite lifeless, fatigued the readers without
interesting or instructing
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span>
Homer came. He, in
his turn, glanced over this pile of sacerdotal traditions,
and raising himself by the force of his genius alone to the
intellectual principle which had conceived them, he grasped
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(ensemble)</i>, and felt all its possibilities. The faculties of
his soul and the precious gifts which he had received from
nature had made him one of those rare men who present
themselves, at long intervals, upon the scene of the world
to enlighten it, shining in the depths of centuries and serving
as torches for mankind. In whatever clime, in whatever
career destiny had placed him, he would have been the
foremost. Ever the same, whether under the thatched roof
or upon the throne, as great in Egypt as in Greece, in the
Occident as in the Orient of Asia, everywhere he had commanded
admiration. Some centuries earlier this same attribute
might have been seen in Krishna or in Orpheus, some
centuries later, in Pythagoras or in Cyrus. Great men are
always great by their own greatness. Incidents which
depend upon chance can only modify. Homer was destined
to poetry by favourable circumstances. Born upon the
borders of the river Meles, of an indigent mother, without
shelter and without kindred, he owed, to a schoolmaster of
Smyrna who adopted him, his early existence and his early
instructions. He was at first called Melesigenes, from the
place of his
birth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span>
Pupil of Phemius, he received from
his benevolent preceptor, simple but pure ideas, which the
activity of his soul developed, which his genius increased,
universalized, and brought to their perfection. His education,
begun with an assiduous and sedentary study, was
perfected through observation. He undertook long journeys
for the sole purpose of instructing himself. The political
conditions, contrary to every other project, favoured
him.</p>

<p>Greece, after having shaken off the yoke of the Phœnicians
and having become the friend of Egypt rather than
her subject, commenced to reap the fruits of the beautiful
institutions that she had received from Orpheus. Powerful
metropolises arose in the heart of this country, long regarded
as a simple colony of Asia, and her native strength being
progressively augmented by the habit of liberty, she had
need of extending herself
abroad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
Rich with the increase
of population, she had reacted upon her ancient metropolis,
had taken possession of a great number of cities on the
opposite shores of Asia, and had colonized
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span>
Phœnicia
humiliated, torn by internal dissensions,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span>
tossed between
the power of the Assyrians and that of the
Egyptians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
saw
this same Greece that she had civilized and to whom she
had given her gods, her laws, and even the letters of her
alphabet, ignore, deny her
benefits,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
take up arms against
her, carry away her colonies from the shores of Italy and of
Sicily, and becoming mistress of the islands of the Archipelago,
tear from her her sole remaining hope, the empire of
the sea.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span>
The people of Rhodes were overpowered.</p>

<p>Homer, of Greek nationality although born in Asia,
profited by these advantages. He set sail in a vessel, whose
patron, Mentes of Leucas, was his friend, wandered over
all the possessions of Greece, visited
Egypt,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
and came to
settle at Tyre. This was the ancient metropolis of Greece,
the source and sacred repository of her mythological traditions.
It was there, in this same temple of the Master of
the Universe,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
where twelve centuries before Sanchoniathon
had come to study the antiquities of the
world,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
that Homer
was able to go back to the origin of Greek cult and fathom
the most hidden meanings of its
mysteries<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span>;
it was there
that he chose the first and noblest subject of his chants,
that which constitutes the fable of the
<cite>Iliad</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span>
If one must
believe in the very singular accounts which time has preserved
to us, thanks to the blind zeal of certain Christians
who have treated them as heresies, this Helen, whose name
applied to the moon signifies the resplendent, this woman
whom Paris carried away from her spouse Menelaus, is
nothing else than the symbol of the human
soul,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
torn by
the principle of generation from that of thought, on account
of which the moral and physical passions declare war. But
it would be taking me too far away from my subject, examining
in detail what might be the meaning of the allegories
of Homer. My plan has not been to investigate this meaning
in particular, but to show that it exists in general.
Upon this point I have not only the rational proof which
results from the concatenation of my ideas, but also proof
of the fact, which is furnished to me by the testimonials of
the ancients. These testimonials are recognized at every
step, in the works of the philosophers and chiefly in those
of the Stoics. Only a very superficial erudition is necessary
to be convinced of
this.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
But I ought to make an observation,
and this observation will be somewhat novel: it is
that, the poetic inspiration being once received by the poet
and his soul finding itself transported into the intelligible
world, all the ideas which then come to him are universal
and in consequence allegorical. So that nothing true may
exist outside of unity, and as everything that is true is one
and homogeneous, it is found that, although the poet gives
to his ideas a form determined in the sentient world, this
form agrees with a multitude of things which, being distinct
in their species, are not so in their genus. This is why
Homer has been the man of all men, the type of all types,
the faithful mirror,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
wherein all ideas becoming reflected
have appeared to be created. Lycurgus read his works,
and saw there a model of his
legislation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
Pericles and Alcibiades
had need of his counsels; they had recourse to him
as a model of statesmen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
He was for Plato the first of the
philosophers, and for Alexander the greatest of kings; and
what is more extraordinary still, even the sectarians, divided
among themselves, were united in him. The Stoics spoke
only of this great poet as a rigid follower of the
Porch<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>;
at the Academy he was considered as the creator of dialectics;
at the Lyceum, the disciples of Aristotle cited him as
a zealous dogmatist<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>;
finally, the Epicureans saw in him
only a man calm and pure, who, satisfied with that tranquil
life where one is wholly possessed by it, seeks nothing
more.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
The temples, which devout enthusiasm consecrated to him,
were the rendezvous for mankind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
Such is the appanage
of universal ideas: they are as the Divinity which inspires
them, all in all, and all in the least parts.</p>

<p>If, at the distance where I am placed, I should dare,
traversing the torrent of ages and opinions, draw near to
Homer and read the soul of this immortal man, I would say,
after having grasped in its entirety the allegorical genius
which makes the essence of poetry, in seeking to give to his
universal ideas a particular form, that his intention was to
personify and paint the passions, and that it was from this
that epopœia had birth. I have not sufficient documents
to attest positively that the word by which one characterizes
this kind of poetry after Homer, did not exist before
him; but I have sufficient to repeat that no one had as yet
recognized its real
nature.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span>
The poems of Corinna, of
Dares, or of Dictys, were only simple extracts from the
mythological cycles, rude copies from certain theosophical
fragments denuded of life; Homer was the first who caused
the <cite>Voice of Impulse</cite>, that is to say Epopœia, to be
understood<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span>:
that kind of poetry which results from intellectual
inspiration united to the enthusiasm of the passions.</p>

<p>In order to attain to the perfection of this kind of poetry,
it is necessary to unite to the imaginative faculty which
feeds the genius, the reason which regulates the impulse,
and the enthusiasm which inflames the mind and supplies
the talent. Homer united them in the most eminent
degree. Thus he possessed the first inspiration and the
complete science, as much in its essence as in its form; for
the poetic form is always dependent upon talent.</p>

<p>This form was then highly favourable to genius. The
Greek verse, measured by musical rhythm and filled with a
happy blending of long and short syllables, had long since
shaken off the servile yoke of rhyme. Now, by rhythm
was understood the number and respective duration of the
time of which a verse was
composed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span>
A long syllable was
equal to a time divided in two instants, and equivalent to
two short syllables. A foot was what we name today a
measure. The foot contained two times, made up of two
long, or of one long and two short syllables. The verse
most commonly used was the hexameter, that is, that in
which the extent was measured by six rhythmic feet and
of which the whole duration was twelve times. Thus poetry
received only the laws of rhythm; it was a kind of music
whose particular harmony, free in its course, was subject
only to measure.</p>

<p>I have never found any authentic evidence that the
Greeks had ever used the rhyme in their verse. It is stated,
however, that they have not differed from other nations
in this respect. Voltaire said so but without
proof.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span>
What
is most certain is that, taking the
word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(epos)</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
a verse, in
its most restricted acceptance, expressing a turn, a turning
around again, the early poets constructed their verse in
form of furrows, going from right to left and returning from
left to right.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span>
Happily this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(bizarrerie)</i> did not last long.
If the Greek verses had thus turned one upon another, or
if the rhyme had forced them to proceed in couplets bent
beneath a servile yoke, Homer would not have created the
Epopœia, or these frivolous obstacles would have vanished
before him. His genius, incapable of enduring chains, would
have refused to clothe itself in a form capable of stifling it.
But this celebrated man would no doubt have changed it;
one can judge by the energetic manner with which he attacked
that which he found in use. The Greek language,
which preserved still in his time something of the Phœnician
stiffness and the Celtic roughness, obliged to adapt
itself to all the movements of his imagination, became the
most flexible and the most harmonious dialect of the earth.
One is astonished, in reading his works, at the boldness of
his composition.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span>
One sees him without the least effort,
bending words at his pleasure, lengthening them, shortening
them to produce something new, reviving those no longer
in use, uniting them, separating them, disposing of them in
an unaccustomed order, forcing them to adapt themselves
everywhere to the harmony that he wishes to depict, to
sentiments of elevation, of pleasure or terror, that he
wishes to inspire.</p>

<p>Thus genius, dominating form, creates master-pieces;
form, on the contrary, commanding genius, produces only
works of the mind. I must say finally and no longer veil
from the attention of my judges, the aim of this discourse:
whenever rhyme exists in the poetic form, it renders the
form inflexible, it brings upon it only the effort of talent
and renders that of intellectual inspiration useless. Never
will the people who rhyme their verses attain to the height
of poetic perfection; never will real epopœia flourish in their
breasts. They will hear neither the accents inspired by
Orpheus, nor the stirring and impassioned harmonies of
Homer. Far from drawing the allegorical genius at its
source and receiving the first inspiration, it will not even
recognize the second one. Its poets will polish painfully
certain impassioned or descriptive verses, and will call
beautiful the works which will only be well done. A rapid
glance over the poetic condition of the earth will prove what
I have advanced. But I ought to explain beforehand what
I understand by first and second inspiration; the moment
has arrived for holding to the promise that I made at the
beginning of this discourse.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Four">§ IV</abbr></p>

<p>You recall, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, that wishing, with Chancellor
Bacon, to distinguish the essence and the form of
Poetry, I have taken my text from the works of Plato. It
is again from this man, justly called divine even by his
rivals, from the founder of the Academy, that I have borrowed
the germ of my idea. This philosopher compares
the effect which the real poets have upon those who hear
them, with the magnetic stone which not only attracts
rings of iron, but communicates to them also the virtue of
attracting other
rings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to appreciate well the force of this thought, and
to follow all the inferences, it is necessary to state a truth
<i>de facto</i>: namely, that the men destined by Providence to
regenerate the world, in whatever manner it may be, to
open any sort of a career, are extremely rare. Nature,
docile to the impulse which she has received of bringing all
to perfection by means of time, elaborates slowly the elements
of their genius, places them at great distances upon
the earth, and makes them appear at epochs very far removed
one from the other. It is necessary that these
events, which determine these men toward an end, should
be brought about in advance; that the physical conditions
in which they are born coincide with the inspiration which
attends them; and therefore everything prepares, everything
protects, everything serves the providential design.
These men, thus scattered over the earth, come among
nations to form them, to give them laws, to enlighten and
to instruct them. They are the beacon-lights of mankind;
these are those to whom I attribute the first inspiration.
This inspiration is immediate; it emanates from the first
principle of all intelligence, in the same manner, to use the
comparison of Plato, that the magnetic force which animates
the loadstone, emanates from its cause. It is profoundly
hidden from our eyes: it is this which fires the genius of a
theosophist such as Thoth, Orpheus, and Zoroaster; the
genius of a theocrat, such as Krishna, Moses, or Mohammed;
the genius of a philosopher, such as Kong-Tse, Pythagoras,
or Socrates; the genius of a poet, such as Homer or Valmiki;
and of a triumphant hero, such as Cyrus, Alexander, or
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Those who follow in the footprints of these primordial
men, who allow themselves to be impressed by their genius,
receive what I call the second inspiration. They can still
be great men; for those who assist them are very great;
they can also communicate the inspiration, for it acts in
them with an exuberant force. Let us confine ourselves
to the poetic inspiration and listen to the voice of Plato:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Muse inspires the poets directly, and these, communicating
to others their enthusiasm, form a chain of inspired men. It
is by means of this chain that the Divinity attracts the souls
of men, and moves them at his pleasure, causing his virtue to
pass from link to link, from the first inspired poet to the last
of his readers or his
rhapsodists.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It is by means of this magnetic chain that one can, in
another sphere of movement, explain this truth so well
known, that great kings make great men; it is also in this
manner that one can understand how a monarch, called to
found a vast empire, makes his will penetrate all hearts,
take possession of all souls, and propagating his valour more
and more, electrify his army and fill it with a multitude of
heroes.</p>

<p>Homer received therefore a first inspiration; he was
created to become the poetic motive of Europe, the principle
of a magnetized chain which, appropriating unceasingly new
links, was to cover Europe with its numberless extensions.
His first conquests were in Greece. His verses, carried from
city to city by actors known under the name of
rhapsodists,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span>

excited the keenest enthusiasm; they passed soon from
mouth to mouth, fixed the attention of legislators, were the
ornament of the most brilliant
fêtes,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span>
and became everywhere
the basis of public
instruction.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
The secret flame which
they concealed, becoming developed in young souls, warmed
there the particular germ which they possessed, and according
to their divers specie and the fertility of the soil,
brought forth many talents.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
The poets who were found
endowed with a genius vast enough to receive the second
inspiration in its entirety, imitated their model and raised
themselves to epopœia. Antimachus and Dicæogenes are
noticeable, the one for his Thebaïs, and the other for his
cyprien verses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span>
Those to whom nature had given passions
more gentle than violent, more touching than vehement,
inclinations more rustic than bellicose, whose souls contained
more sensitiveness than elevation, were led to copy certain
isolated groups of this vast tableau, and placing them,
following their tastes, in the palace or in the thatched cottage,
caused accents of joy or of sorrow, the plaints of heroes or
the sports of shepherds to be heard, and thus created elegy,
eclogue, or idyl.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
Others, on the contrary, whose too vehement
enthusiasm shortened the duration of it, whose keen
fiery passions had left little empire for reason, who allowed
themselves to be drawn easily toward the object of which
they were momentarily captive, created the ode, dithyramb,
or song, according to the nature of their genius and the object
of their passion. These were more numerous than all the
others together, and the women who were here distinguished,
rivalled and even surpassed the men; Corinna and Myrtis
did not yield either to
Stesićhorus,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
or to Pindar; Sappho
and Telesilla effaced Alcæus and
Anacreon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that the art with which Homer had put into
action gods and men, had opposed heaven and earth, and
depicted the combats of the passions; this art, being joined
to the manner in which the rhapsodists declaimed his
poems<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span>
by alternately relieving one another, and covering themselves
with garments of different colours adapted to the situation,
had insensibly given rise to dramatic style and to theatrical
representation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
This, true in a sense, has need of a distinction:
it will serve at the same time to throw light upon
what I am about to say.</p>

<p>One should remember that the intellectual and rational
poetry, or theosophical and philosophical, illustrated by
Orpheus and which Homer had united with the enthusiasm
of the passions in order to constitute epopœia, although
separated from the latter, existed none the less. Whereas
the disciples of Homer, or the
Homeridæ,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
spread themselves
abroad and took possession of the laic or profane world,
the religious and learned world was always occupied by the
disciples of Orpheus, called
Eumolpidæ.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
The hierophants
and philosophers continued to write as formerly upon theology
and natural philosophy. There appeared from time
to time theogonies and cosmological
systems,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
dionysiacs,
heraclides,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
oracles, treatises on nature and moral apologues,
which bore no relation to epopœia. The hymns or pæans
which had emanated from the sanctuaries in honour of the
Divinity, had in no wise resembled either the odes or the
dithyrambs of the lyric
poets<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span>:
as much as the former were
vehement and passionate, so much the latter affected to be
calm and majestic. There existed therefore, at this epoch,
two kinds of poetry, equally beautiful when they had attained
their respective perfection: Eumolpique Poetry and
Epic Poetry: the first, intellectual and rational; the other,
intellectual and passionate.</p>

<p>However, the divine mysteries, hidden from the profane,
manifested to the initiates in the ceremonies and symbolic
fables, had not as yet issued from the sanctuaries: it had
been nearly a thousand years since they had been instituted
by Orpheus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
when suddenly one saw for the first time
certain of these fables and these ceremonies ridiculously
travestied, transpiring among the people and serving them
for amusement. The fêtes of Dionysus, celebrated in the
times of vintage, gave place to this sort of profanation.
The grape-gatherers, besmeared with lees, giving way in the
intoxication of wine to an indiscreet enthusiasm, began to
utter aloud from their wagons the allegories that they had
learned in their rural initiations. These allegories, which
neither the actors nor the spectators had comprehended in
reality, appeared, nevertheless, piquant to both through the
malicious interpretations which they gave
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span>
Such
were the feeble beginnings of dramatic art in
Greece<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span>;
there
was born the profanation of the Orphic mysteries, in the
same manner that one sees it reborn among us, by the profanation
of the Christian
mysteries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>
But this art was already
old in Asia when it sprang up in Europe. I have
already said that there was in the secret celebration of the
mysteries, veritable dramatic representations. These mystic
ceremonies, copied from those which had taken place
in the celebration of the Egyptian mysteries, had been
brought into Egypt by the Indian priests at a very remote
epoch when the empire of Hindustan had extended over
this country. This communication, which was made from
one people to another, has been demonstrated to the point
of evidence by the learned researches of the academicians
of Calcutta, Jones, Wilford, and
Wilkin,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span>
who have proved
what Bacon had previously said in speaking of the Greek
traditions, “that it was only a very light air which, passing
by means of an ancient people into the flutes of Greece, had
been modulated by them into sounds more sweet, more
harmonious, and more conformable to the climate and to
their brilliant imagination.”</p>

<p>A singular coincidence, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, which will not escape
your sagacity, is that dramatic art, whose origin is lost in
India in the night of time, has likewise had its birth in the
mysteries of religion. It is during the <i>Ram-Jatra</i>, a fête
celebrated annually in honour of Rama, the same as Dionysus
of the Greeks, or Bacchus of the Latins, that one still
sees theatrical representations which have served as models
for the more regular works that have been made in the
course of time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span>
These representations, which run through
nearly all the exploits of Rama and through the victory
that this beneficent god gained over Rawhan, the principle
of evil, are mingled with chants and recitations exactly as
were those of the ancient Greeks. You understand, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>,
that the first efforts of tragedy were to celebrate the
conquests of Bacchus and his triumph, of which that of
Apollo over the serpent Python, celebrated by the Pythian
games, was the emblem.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>
Those of the Indians who appear
to have preserved the most ancient traditions, since the
sacred books were written in the Pali language, considered
as anterior to the Sanskrit by some savants, the Burmans,
have from time immemorial recorded the mysteries of Rama
in scenic dramas which are still performed in public on the
fête day of this god.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
I do not consider it amiss to mention
here that the name of Rama, which in Sanskrit signifies
that which is dazzling and beautiful, that which is sublime
and protective, has had the same signification in
Phœnician,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>
and that it is from this same name to which is joined
a demonstrative article common to Aramaic, Chaldean, and
Syriac, that the word drama<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
is formed, and which being
adopted by the Greek tongue, has passed afterwards into
the Latin tongue and into ours. This word has expressed
an action, because, in truth, it depicts one in the mysteries
and besides its primitive root refers to regular movement
in general.</p>

<p>But as my purpose is not to follow at present dramatic
art in all its ramifications and as it suffices me to have indicated
clearly the origin, I return to Greece.</p>

<p>The spectacle of which I have spoken, effect of a Bacchic
enthusiasm, and at first abandoned to the caprice of certain
rustic grape-gatherers whose indiscretions did not appear
formidable, struck so forcibly by its novelty and produced
such a marvellous effect upon the people, that it was not
long before certain men of most cultivated minds were seen
desirous of taking part either from liking or from interest.
Thespis and Susarion appeared at the same time and each
seized, according to his character, one the noble and serious
side and the other the ridiculous and amusing side of the
mythological fables; dividing thus from its birth, dramatic
art and distinguishing it by two kinds, tragedy and comedy:
that is, the lofty and austere chant, and the joyous and
lascivious chant.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span>
<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, the governments, until then quite
indifferent to these rustic amusements, warned that certain
liberties permitted by Thespis were becoming too flagrant,
began to see the profanations which had resulted, and of
which the Eumolpidæ had no doubt pointed out the
consequences.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
They tried to prevent them, and Solon even
made a law regarding this
subject<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>;
but it was too late:
the people attracted in crowds to these representations, all
informal as they were, rendered useless the foresight of the
legislator. It was necessary to yield to the torrent and,
being unable to arrest it, to strive at least to restrain it
within just limits. A clear field was left open for the
good that it was able to do, in fertilizing the new ideas,
and severe rules were opposed to check whatever dangers
its invasions might have for religion and for customs. The
dramatic writers were permitted to draw the subject of
their pieces from the source of the mysteries, but it was
forbidden them, under penalty of death, to divulge the
sense. Æschylus, first of the dramatic poets, having involuntarily
violated this law, ran the risk of losing his
life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
Discriminating judges were established to pronounce upon
the excellency of the works offered in the competition, and
one was very careful not to abandon oneself at first to the
passionate acclamations of the people, and the approbations
or disapprobations of the maxims which were therein
contained.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
These judges, proficient in the knowledge of
music and of poetry, had to listen in silence until the end,
and maintain all in order and decency. Plato attributes to
the desuetude into which this law fell, and to the absolute
dominion which the people assumed over the theatre, the
first decadence of the art and its entire corruption.</p>

<p>Æschylus, whom I have just named, was the true creator
of dramatic art. Strong with the inspiration which he had
received from Homer,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
he transported into tragedy the style
of epopœia, and animated it with a music grave and simple.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>

Not content with the moral beauties with which his genius
embellished it, he wished that music, painting, and dancing
might lend their aid and contribute to the illusion of the
senses. He caused a theatre to be built where the most
ingenious devices, the most magnificent decorations displayed
their magic effects.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
One saw in the tragedy of
Prometheus, the earth trembling, clouds of dust rising in
the air; one heard the whistling of wind, the crash of thunder;
one was dazzled by the lightnings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
Old Ocean appeared
upon the waves, and Mercury came from the heights of
heaven to announce the commands of Jupiter. In the
tragedy of the Eumenides, these infernal divinities appeared
upon the scene to the number of fifty, clothed in black robes;
blood-stained, the head bristling with serpents, holding in
one hand a torch and in the other a
lash.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
They replied to
the shade of Clytemnestra, who invoked them, by a choir
of music so frightful, that a general terror having struck
the assembly, certain of the women experienced premature
pains of confinement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>One feels, after this, that Greek tragedy had in its theatrical
forms, much in common with our modern operas;
but what eminently distinguishes it is that, having come
forth complete from the depths of the sanctuaries, it possessed
a moral sense which the initiates understood. This
is what put it above anything that we might be able to
conceive today; what gave it an inestimable price. Whereas
the vulgar, dazzled only by the pomp of the spectacle,
allured by the beauty of the verse and the music, enjoyed
merely a fleeting gratification, the wise tasted a pleasure
more pure and more durable, by receiving the truth in their
hearts even from the deceitful delusions of the senses. This
pleasure was as much greater as the inspiration of the poet
had been more perfect, and as he had succeeded better in
making the allegorical spirit felt, without betraying the veil
which covered it.</p>

<p>Æschylus went further in comprehension of the subject
than any of his successors. His plans were of an extreme
simplicity. He deviated little from the mythological
tradition.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
All his efforts tended only to give light to their
teachings, to penetrate into their hidden beauties. The
characters of his heroes, strongly drawn, sustained them
at heights where Homer had placed them. He caused
terror to pass before them that they might be
frightened.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
His aim was to lead them to virtue by terror, and to inspire
the soul with a force capable of resisting alike the intoxications
of prosperity and the discouragements of poverty.</p>

<p>Sophocles and Euripides followed closely Æschylus and
surpassed him in certain portions of the art; the first, even
triumphed over him in the eyes of the
multitude<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>;
but the
small number of sages, faithful to the true principles, regarded
him always as the father of
tragedy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>
One can
admit that Sophocles was more perfect in the conduct of
his plans, in the regularity of his

that Euripides was
more natural and more tender, more skilful in arousing
interest, in stirring the
passions<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>;
but these perfections,
resulting from the form, had not been acquired without
the very essence of drama being altered; that is to say,
without the allegorical genius which had presided at the
composition of the fables that the poets had always drawn
from the religious mysteries, suffering many deviations,
which rendered it often unrecognizable through the foreign
adornments with which it was burdened. Sophocles and
above all Euripides, by devoting themselves to perfecting
the form, really harmed therefore the principle of the art
and hastened its corruption. If the laws which had at first
been promulgated against those who in treating of the
tragic subjects vilified the mysterious sense had been executed,
Euripides would not have been allowed to depict
so many heroes degraded by adversity, so many princesses
led astray by love, so many scenes of shame, of scandal, and
of crime<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span>;
but the people, already degraded and bordering
upon corruption, allowed themselves to be drawn along by
these dangerous tableaux and hastened half-way to meet
the poisoned cup which was offered to them.</p>

<p>It must candidly be admitted, that it is to the very charm
of these tableaux, to the talent with which Euripides understood
how to colour them, that the decadence of Athenian
manners and the first harm done to the purity of religion
must be attributed. The theatre, having become the
school of the passions, and offering to the soul no spiritual
nourishment, opened a door through which doubt, contempt,
and derision for the mysteries, the most sacrilegious audacity,
and utter forgetfulness of the Divinity, insinuated
themselves even unto the sanctuaries. Æschylus had represented
in his heroes, supernatural
personages<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span>;
Sophocles
painted simple heroes, and Euripides, characters often less
than men.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span>
Now these personages were, in the eyes of the
people, either children of the gods, or the gods themselves.
What idea could be formed then of their weaknesses, of
their crimes, of their odious or ridiculous conduct, particularly
when these weaknesses or these crimes were no longer
represented as allegories from which it was necessary to
seek the meaning, but as historical events or frivolous plays
of the imagination? The people, according to the degree of
their intelligence, became either impious or superstitious;
the savants professed to doubt all, and the influential men,
by feigning to believe all, regarded all parties with an equal
indifference. This is exactly what happened. The mysteries
became corrupt because one was accustomed to regard
them as corrupt; and the people became intolerant and
fanatical, each one cringing with fear, lest he be judged what
he really was, namely, impious.</p>

<p>Such was the effect of dramatic art in Greece. This
effect, at first imperceptible, became manifest to the eyes
of the sages, when the people became the dictators of the
theatre and ignored the judges named to pronounce upon
the works of the poets; When the poets, jealous of obtaining
the approval of the multitude, consulted its taste rather
than truth, its versatile passions rather than reason, and
sacrificed to its caprices the laws of honesty and
excellence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_165" id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as tragedy, disparaging the mysteries of the
fables had transformed them into historical facts, it needed
only a step to raise historical facts to the rank of subjects
of tragedy. Phrynichus was, it is said, the first who had
this audacity. He produced in the theatre, the <cite>Conquest
of Miletus</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_166" id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span>
The people of Athens, with a whimsicality
which is characteristic of them, condemned the poet to a
very heavy fine, for having disobeyed the law and crowned
him because of the tears which they shed at the representation
of his work. But this was not enough, confounding
thus reality and allegory; soon, sacred and profane things
were mingled by forging without any kind of moral aim,
subjects wholly false and fantastic. The poet Agathon,
who was the author of this new profanation had been the
friend of Euripides.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span>
He proved thus that he knew nothing
of the essence of dramatic poetry and makes it doubtful
whether Euripides knew it any better.</p>

<p>Thus, in the space of less than two centuries, tragedy,
borne upon the car of Thespis, elevated by Æschylus to a
nobler theatre, carried to the highest degree of splendour
by Sophocles, had already become weakened in the hands
of Euripides, had lost the memory of its celestial origin
with Agathon, and abandoned to the caprices of a populace
as imperious as ignorant, inclined toward a rapid
degeneration.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span>
Comedy less reserved did not have a happier destiny.
After having hurled its first darts upon the heroes and demi-gods
of Greece, having taken possession of certain very
unguarded allegories, to turn even the gods to
ridicule<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_169" id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span>;
after having derided Prometheus and Triptolemus, Bacchus
and the Bacchantes, after having made sport of heaven
and earth, of the golden age and the seasons<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span>;
it attacked
men in general and in particular, ridiculed their absurdities,
pursued their vices, real or imaginary, and delivered them
both unsparingly, without pity, to derision and
contempt.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
Epicharmus, who gave certain rules to the indecent farces
of Susarion, was followed by Magnes, Cratinus, Eupolis,
and a crowd of other comic poets, until Aristophanes whose
bitter satires no longer finding sufficient influence in certain
obscure ridicules, applied themselves to disparaging science
and virtue, and twenty years beforehand, prepared and
envenomed the hemlock by which Socrates was poisoned.
It is true that some time after, Menander tried to reform
this terrible abuse and gave to comedy a form less revolting;
but he was only able to do so by detaching it completely
from its origin, that is to say, by severing it from all that
it had preserved, intellectually and allegorically, and reducing
it to the representation of certain tableaux and certain
events of the social life.</p>

<p>In going back, as I have just done, to the origin of poetic
science in order to distinguish first, its essence from its form
and afterwards, to follow its diverse developments, in genus
and in kind, I have related many things and cited a great
number of subjects with which you are familiar; but you
will no doubt excuse, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, these numerous reminiscences
and citations, in reflecting that although but little
necessary for you, they were infinitely so for me, since
presenting myself in the lists and wishing to give an added
form to this science which belongs to you, I must prove
to you that I have at least studied it profoundly.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Five">§ V</abbr></p>

<p>Now, summing up what I have said, it will be found
that poetry, entirely intellectual in its origin and destined
only to be the language of the gods, owed its first
developments in Greece to Orpheus, its second to Homer,
and its last to Æschylus. These three creative men, seizing
the different germs of this science still shrouded in their
formless rudiments, warmed them with the fire of their
genius and according to the particular inspiration of each,
led them to the perfection of which they were susceptible.
All three of them were the object of a first inspiration,
although influenced one by the other, and were able to
communicate the magnetic power to new disciples. Orpheus
possessor of intellectual and rational poetry, constituted
that which I call <i>Eumolpœia</i>, which, being divided into
theosophy and philosophy, produces all the works which
treat of the Divinity, of the Universe, of Nature, and of
Man in general.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span>
Homer, in joining to this spiritual poetry
the enthusiasm of the passions, created Epopœia, whose
magnificent genus envelops a multitude of specie, where
the intellectual faculty and passion dominate with more or
less energy under the influence of imagination. Homer
rendered sentient that which was intelligible and particularized
that which Orpheus had left universal: Æschylus,
trying to bring into action what these two divine men had
left with potentiality, formed the idea of dramatic or active
poetry, in which he claimed to include whatever Eumolpœia
and Epopœia had in common, that was moral, allegorical,
and passionate. He would have succeeded, perhaps, and
then would have produced the most perfect work of thought,
passion, and action possible for men, conceived by genius
and executed by talent; but Greece, exhausted by the abundant
harvest obtained by Orpheus and Homer, lacked the
sap to give nourishment to this new plant. Corrupted in
its germ, this plant degenerated rapidly, deteriorated, and
put forth only a vain show of branches without elevation
and without virtue. The heroes of Thermopylæ succumbed
under the burden of their laurels. Given over to a foolish
arrogance, they covered with an unjust contempt their
preceptors and their fathers; they persecuted, they assassinated
their defenders and their sages and, base tyrants of
the theatre, they prepared themselves to bow the head
beneath the yoke of the king of Macedonia.</p>

<p>This king, victor at Chæronea, became arbiter of Greece,
and his son, providential instrument of the ascendancy
which Europe was to have over Asia, crossing the Hellespont
at the head of an army that his genius alone rendered
formidable, overthrew the empire of Cyrus and stood for
a moment upon its débris: I say for a moment, because it
was not here that the new empire was to be established:
Europe had still obeyed; she was one day to command.
Rome was already, in the thought of the future, the culminating
point of the earth. A few centuries sufficed for this
city, then unknown,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span>
to attain to the height of glory.
Emerging from her obscurity, conquering Pyrrhus, dominating
Italy, combating and overthrowing Carthage, conquering
Greece, and trampling under foot twenty diadems
borne by the successors of Alexander, was for this ambitious
Republic the work of a few centuries. But it is not true,
although certain men whose virtue was not enlightened by
the torch of experience may have been able to say it; it is
not true that a republic, already perplexed in governing
itself, can govern the world. It requires an empire, and
this empire is created.</p>

<p>Cæsar laid its foundation, Augustus strengthened it.
The sciences and arts, brought to Rome from the heart of
Greece, came out then from their lethargy and flourished
with a new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i>. Poetry, especially, found numberless
admirers. Vergil, strongly attracted by the magnetic
flame of Homer, dared to tread in his light, overthrew all
the obstacles that time had raised, and drawing near to
this divine model, received from him the second inspiration
without intermediary and without rival. Ovid, less determined,
hovering between Orpheus and Homer, succeeded,
however, in uniting the second inspiration of the one to
the third inspiration of the other, and left in his book of
<cite>Metamorphoses</cite> a monument not less brilliant and more
inimitable than the <cite>Æneid</cite>. Horace, little satisfied with
succeeding Pindar, sought and found the means of uniting
to the enthusiasm of the passions the calm of rational
poetry, and, establishing himself a legislator of Parnassus,
dictated laws to the poets, or jeered at the absurdities of
men.</p>

<p>This poetry of reason had long since fallen into desuetude.
The false movement that dramatic poetry had
taken in Greece, the contempt that it had come to inspire
for gods and men, had reacted upon it. The philosophers,
disdaining a science which, by its own admission, was
founded upon falsehood, had driven it from their writings.
As much as they searched for it, when they believed it an
emanation of the Divinity, so much had they fled from it
since they had come to see in it only the vain production of
an insensate delirium. Here is an observation, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>,
somewhat new, with which I may engage your attention:
the first comedies appeared five hundred and eighty years
before our era, which was about twenty years after Pherecydes
wrote the first work in
prose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
This philosopher
doubtless, did not believe that a language prostituted to the
burlesque parodies of Susarion should be useful further to
the meditations of the sages. It is not, however, that at
long intervals certain philosophers such as Empedocles,
Parmenides, and many others of their disciples, have not
written in verse<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>;
but the remains of the ancient usage soon
gave way, especially when Plato had embellished prose with
the charm of his captivating eloquence. Before this philosopher,
Herodotus had read in the assembly of the Olympic
games an history of Greece connected with that of the
greater part of the neighbouring
nations.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span>
This work,
written in a fluent style, clear and persuasive, had so enchanted
the Greeks, that they had given to the nine books
which he composed, the names of the nine Muses. Nevertheless,
an observation which will not be wholly foreign here,
is, that the admission of prose in philosophy, instead of
rational poetry, produced a style of work hitherto unknown,
and of which the moderns made much; I am speaking of positive
history. Before this epoch, history written in verse was,
as I have said, allegorical and figurative, and was occupied
only with the masses without respect to individuals. Thus
the evil which resulted on the one side, from the degradation
experienced by poetry in one of its branches, was balanced
by the good which was promised on the other, from the
purification of prose for the advancement of exact knowledge.</p>

<p>But returning to what I said just now on the subject of
rational poetry, joined by the Romans to the passionate
part of that science, I will say that this union created a
new style, of which Horace was the originator: this was the
didactic style. This style ought not to be confused with
rational poetry, of which Hesiod has made use in his poem
of <cite>Works and Days</cite>, and which pertains to Eumolpœia;
nor with pure rational poetry, such as one finds in the writings
of Parmenides and Empedocles: it is a sort of poetry
which, attaching itself to form alone, depends much upon
dramatic art. The didactic, satirical, or simply descriptive
poet is similar to an actor on the stage declaiming a long
monologue. Rational poetry was welcomed at Rome, and
drawn from the long oblivion into which it had fallen, by
Lucretius who, being inspired by the works of Leucippus
and of Epicurus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
wrote a book upon the nature of things,
which has never been as yet well comprehended or well
translated, the language not being understood.</p>

<p>Comedy, reformed by Menander, was again improved
by Plautus and by Terence who acquired much reputation
in this style; as to dramatic art in itself, it remained in its
inertia. The Romans having the same gods and nearly
the same mythology as the Greeks, were neither sufficiently
elevated in intelligence to reinstate this art and make of
it the masterpiece of the human mind; nor sufficiently
advanced in exact knowledge to change wholly its forms and
make of it, as we have, a new art, whence allegory and the
moral part of Eumolpœia have been completely banished.
But what the Romans were unable to do for dramatic art,
they unfortunately were able to do for Epopœia. Certain
writers, able versifiers, but absolutely deprived of intellectual
inspiration, incapable of distinguishing in poetry the
essence from the form, following what the degenerated
theatre and the inspired declamations of
Euhemerus<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
had
taught them, imagined foolishly that the gods and heroes
of antiquity having been only men stronger and more powerful
than the others, mythology was only a crude collection
of historic facts disfigured, and Epopœia only an emphatic
discourse upon these same
facts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span>
Thereupon they believed
that it was only a question of taking any historic
subject whatever, and relating it in verse with certain embellishments,
to create an epic poem. Lucan and Silius
Italicus, in choosing, the one the misfortunes of Pompey,
and the other the victories of Hannibal, considered themselves
superior to Homer or Vergil, as much as they supposed
Rome or Carthage superior to Ilium. But a just posterity,
notwithstanding the prejudices of their panegyrists, has
put them in their place. It has considered them merely
the inventors of a kind of bastard poetry, which might be
called historic poetry. This poetry, entirely separated
from Eumolpœia, whose moral essence it is unable to realize,
preserves only the material and physical forms of true
Epopœia. It is a body without soul, which is moved by a
mechanical mainspring applied by a skilful workman.</p>

<p>As to the poetic form in itself, its only point of variance
with the Greeks and Romans was that of elegance. The
verses written in the same manner, depended likewise upon a
fixed number of time or of feet regulated by musical rhythm.
If rhyme had been admitted there in the first ages, it had
been excluded early enough so that there remained no longer
the least trace of it. The Latin tongue, very far from the
Greek in flexibility, variety, and harmony, for a long time
treated with contempt by the Greeks who, regarding it as
a barbarous dialect, only learned it with
repugnance<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span>;

the Latin tongue, I say, unpleasing, obscure, not even supporting
the mediocrity of ordinary elocution, became,
through the laborious efforts of its writers, a tongue which
in the works of Vergil, for example, attained such a perfection,
that it came to be doubted, owing to the grace, the
justice, and the force of its expression, whether the author
of the <cite>Æneid</cite> did not surpass the author of the <cite>Iliad</cite>. Such
is the empire of forms. They alone make problematical
that which, in its essence, should not be subject to the least
discussion.</p>

<p>But at last the Roman Eagle, after having soared some
time in the universe and covered with his extended wings
the most beautiful countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa,
fatigued by its own triumphs, sank down again, allowed its
power to be divided, and from the summit of this same Capitol,
whence it had for such a long time hurled its thunderbolts,
saw the vultures of the North divide among them its
spoils. The mythological religion, misunderstood in its
principles, attacked in its forms, given over to the corruption
of things and men, had disappeared to give place to a
new religion, which born in obscurity, was raised imperceptibly
from the ranks of the humblest citizens to the imperial
throne. Constantine, who in embracing the Christian
cult had consolidated that religious revolution, believed
himself able to bring about another in politics, by transferring
the seat of his empire to the Bosphorus. Historians
have often blamed this last movement; but they have not
seen that Providence, in inspiring this division of the empire,
foresaw that the darkness of ignorance rolling with the waves
of the barbarians was about to extend as far as Rome, and
that it would be necessary to concentrate at one point a part
of the learning, in order to save it from the general ruin.
Whereas the Empire of the Occident, assailed on all sides
by the hordes from the North, was overthrown, torn, divided
into numberless small sovereignties whose extent was often
limited to the donjon where the sovereign resided; the Empire
of the Orient sustained the weight of the hordes from the
South, nourished continually in its midst certain men, guardians
of the sacred fire of science, and did not fall until more
than nine centuries later; and learning, commencing its
revival in the Occident, put minds in condition there, to
appreciate the models which were about to be presented
to them and rendered them capable of receiving their
inspiration.</p>

<p>It was a very remarkable epoch, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, which saw
grouped about it in the space of less than a half century
and coincident with the downfall of the Empire of the Orient,
the use of gunpowder, of the compass, of the telescope in
the Occident; the invention of engraving upon copper, that
of movable characters for printing, the extension of commerce
and navigation by the passage around the cape of Storms,
and finally the discovery of America. It was a very extraordinary
century, in which were born Mohammed II. and
Lorenzo de’ Medici, Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus,
Theodoros Gaza and Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo
da Vinci and Bojardo, Leo X. and Luther. After the invasion
of the barbarians, Christian Europe had lost its political
unity: it was as a great republic whose divided members,
struggling continuously one against the other, tearing by
turn a shadow of supremacy, were the realms, the pontifical
or laic principalities, the republics, the free and commercial
cities. The two chiefs of this gigantic and badly organized
body, the German Emperor and the Pope, bishop of Rome,
were vested only with a grandeur of opinion; their real power
was void: they were nothing more, in fact, than that which
they appeared in form. Since Charlemagne, who, in a
century of darkness enlightened with his own genius, had
had the force to grasp the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(débris)</i> of the empire, uniting them
in his hand and giving them a momentary existence, it had
not had an emperor. The vain efforts of Hildebrand and
of Charles V. had served only at different times and under
different conditions to demonstrate their impotence. It
was reserved for a much greater man to dominate Europe
regenerated by violent shocks, and to show to the universe
the legitimate successor of Augustus wreathed with the
imperial crown.</p>

<p>But without in any way anticipating time, without even
leaving our subject which is poetry, let us continue to follow
the developments of this science.</p>

<p>The original poets of Greece and Rome, brought into
Italy by the savants whom the taking of Constantinople
forced to go back towards the Occident of Europe, brought
there an unexpected brilliancy, which, with the ancient
germs deeply buried in its midst, soon awakened certain
new germs that the peculiar circumstances had also brought
there. In explaining what these germs were, I am giving
occasion for thinkers to make certain reflections, and critics
to form certain singular conjectures upon works hitherto
badly judged.</p>

<p>It is necessary at first, that I repeat a truth which I
have already said: that intellectual nature is always one
and the same, whereas physical nature varies, changes
unceasingly with time and place, and is modified in a
thousand ways according to circumstances. Now, it is
this latter nature which gives the form, that is to say,
which renders sentient and particular that which the
former gives to it as universal and intelligible; so that
its aptitude more or less great, in receiving and in
working upon the intelligence, can make the things which
are more homogeneous in their principle appear more
dissimilar in their effect. I will give a proof. Whilst
the most profound obscurity covered Europe, whilst
ignorance spread on all sides its baleful veils, there were
found, however, at long intervals, certain privileged men,
who, raising themselves above these thick vapours, came to
grasp certain faint glimmerings of the light shining always
above them. These men possessors of such rare gifts,
would have indeed wished to communicate them to their
contemporaries, but if they imprudently opened their
mouths, the blind and fanatic horde which surrounded them
cried out forthwith against the heretic, the magician, the
sorcerer, and conducted them to torture as the price of their
lessons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span>
After several sorry examples, these men, having
become prudent, assumed the part of silence by retiring
into monasteries or hermitages, studying Nature there in
quietude, and profiting alone by their discoveries. If certain
ones still dared to speak, it was by borrowing the style of
religion, or history, diverting from the ordinary sense certain
ideas received, explaining themselves by enigmas, or by
figures, which, when necessary, they were able to explain
as they wished.</p>

<p>Among this number was a man of strong imagination
and of a genius really poetic, who, having grasped certain
truths of nature, and judging it proper not to divulge them,
took the expedient of enclosing them in a book which he
entitled: <cite>Les Faits et Gestes de Charles-Magne</cite>. This extraordinary
man who has, in these modern times, obtained an
ascendancy greater than one could ever have imagined,
since he is the vital source whence have come all the orders,
all the institutions of chivalry with which Europe has been
inundated; this man, I say, was a monk of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(Saint-André de
Vienne)</i>, living from the tenth to the eleventh century and
perhaps a little
before.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span>
The book that he composed had a
success as much the more prodigious as it was misunderstood,
and such was the ignorance not only of the people, but even
of the clergy, that the most palpable fictions were taken for
realities. There are historians even who pretend that
the council of Rheims, celebrated in 1119, declared this
work authentic<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>;
and thence came the habit of attributing
it to Archbishop Turpin. However that may be, it is to
the allegorical history of Charlemagne, to that of his twelve
paladins, called peers of France, to that of the four sons of
Aymon and of Chevalier Bayard, to that of Renaud, Roland,
Richard, and the other heroes of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(bibliothèque bleue)</i>, for
a long time our only <i>bibliotheca</i>, that we owe a new style of
poetry, called Romanesque, on account of the Romance
tongue in which it had
birth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span>
This style is to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(eumolpique)</i>
style, as a wild offshoot, growing laboriously in an arid and
bramble-covered land, is to a cultivated tree which rises
majestically in the heart of a fertile country.</p>

<p>It was with the chivalrous ideas, inspired by the book
of the monk of Saint André, that the first poetic ideas were
brought forth in France. The Oscan troubadours seizing
these first glimmerings of genius, threw themselves with
enthusiasm into a career which offered at the same time
pleasures, glory, and the gifts of
fortune.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span>
They sang of the
fair, of gallants and of kings; but their verses, monotonous
enough when a real passion did not animate them, hardly
reached above eulogy or satire. But little capable of feeling
the moral beauties of poetry, they stopped at form.
The rhyme for them was everything. For them the supreme
talent was only rhyming much and with difficulty. One
could not imagine to what lengths they went in this style.
Not content with restricting themselves to follow the same
rhyme throughout the entire course of the poem, they sometimes
doubled it at the end of each verse, rhyming by echo,
or else they made an initial rhyme.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span>
These obstacles becoming
multiplied stifled their muse in its cradle. All that
art owed to these first modern poets was limited to a sort
of song, gay and sprightly, ordinarily a parody upon a
more serious subject, and which, because it was quite frequently
sung with an air of the dance accompanied by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(vielle)</i> or <i>hurdy-gurdy</i>, their favourite instrument, was called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(vau-de-vielle)</i>, or as is pronounced today, vaudeville.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The Italians and Spaniards, who received from the
Oscan troubadours their first impulse toward poetry, would
have been perhaps as limited as they, to composing amorous
sonnets, madrigals or, at the most, certain vehement
<i>sylves</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span>
if the Greeks, driven from their country by the conquests of
Mohammed II., had not brought them the works of the
ancients as I have already said. These works, explained
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(chaire publique)</i>, due to the munificence of the Medicis,
struck particularly the Italians: not however by exciting
their poets to take them as models; the turn of their mind
and the form of their poetry, similar in everything to that
of the troubadours, were opposed too obviously here; but
by giving them that sort of emulation which, without copying
the others, makes one strive to equal them. At this
epoch the book of the monk of St. André, attributed as I
have said to Archbishop Turpin, already more than four
centuries old, was known by all Europe, whether by itself,
or whether by the numberless imitations of which it had
been the subject. Not only France, Spain, Italy, but also
England and Germany were inundated with a mass of romances
and ballads, wherein were pictured the knights of the
court of Charlemagne and those of the Round
Table.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
All
these works were written in verse, and the greater part,
particularly those composed by the troubadours or their
disciples, intended to be sung, were cut into strophes. Those
of the imitator poets, who had had the force to go back to
the allegorical sense of their model, had only developed and
enriched it with their own knowledge; the others, following
their various methods of considering it, had chosen subjects
real and historical, or indeed had followed ingenuously
without aim or plan, the impulse of their vagabond imagination.
In France could be seen represented by the side of
the stories of Tristan, of Lancelot, of the Grail, and of Ogier-le-Danois,
that of Alexander the Great and of the Bible,
that of the Seven Sages and of Judas Maccabeus, that of
the History of the Normands and the Bretons, and finally
that of the Rose, the most famous of all. A certain Guilhaume
had published a philosophical romance upon the
nature of beasts.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Already the Italian poets, after having received from
the troubadours the form of their verses and that of their
works, had surpassed their masters and had caused them to
be forgotten. Petrarch in the sonnet and Dante in the
<i>sirvente</i> assumed all the glory of their models, and left not
any for the successors<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>;
already even Bojardo and some
others had attempted, with the example of Homer, to bring
back to the unity of epopœia, the incongruous and fantastic
scenes of the romance, when Ariosto appeared. This man,
gifted with a keen and brilliant imagination, and possessor
of a matchless talent, executed what no one else had been
able to do before him; he was neither inspired by Homer,
nor by Vergil; he copied no one. He learned from them
only to raise himself to the poetic source, to see it where it
was and to draw from it his genius. Then he received a
first inspiration and became the creator of a particular
style of poetry which may be called romantic. Undoubtedly
this style is greatly inferior to epopœia; but after all it is
original: its beauties as well as its faults belong to him.</p>

<p>Almost the same moment when Ariosto enriched Europe
with his new poetry, Camoëns wished to naturalize it in
Portugal; but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(mélange)</i> of Vergil and Lucan that he
essayed to make, betrayed his lack of understanding and
he did not succeed. I mention it only that you may observe,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, that the form adopted by the Portuguese
poet is exactly the same as the one which Ariosto, his predecessors
and his successors, have followed in Italy: it is
that of the troubadours. The poems of each are long ballads,
intersected by strophes of eight lines of alternate rhymes
which, succeeding one another with the same measure, can
be sung from one end to the other, with an appropriate air,
and which in fact, as J. J. Rousseau has very well remarked,
were sung frequently. In these poems, the essence is in
accord with the form, and it is this that makes their regularity.
It is not the epopœia of Homer drawn from the
Orphic source, it is the romantic poetry of Ariosto, an issue
of the fictions attributed to Archbishop Turpin, which is
associated with the verses of the troubadours. These
verses subjected to rhyme are incapable in any tongue of
attaining the sublime heights of Eumolpœia or of Epopœia.</p>

<p>The French poets soon proved it, when coming to understand
the works of Homer and Vergil, they thought themselves
able to imitate them by making use of the same poetic
forms by which the authors of <cite>Perceval</cite> or <cite>Berthe-au-grand-pied</cite>
had profited. It was all to no purpose that they worked
these forms, striking them upon the anvil, polishing them,
they remained inflexible. Ronsard was the first who made
the fatal experiment; and after him a crowd of careless
persons came to run aground upon the same reef. These
forms always called up the spirit with which they were born;
the melancholy and unceasing sound, sonorous with their
rhymes in couplets or alternate, had something soporific
which caused the soul to dream and which allured it in spite
of itself, not into the sublime regions of allegory where
the genius of Eumolpœia was nourished, but into vague
spaces of fictions, where, under a thousand whimsical forms
the romantic mind evaporates. Doubtless one would have
been able, in France, to limit the Italian poets, as had been
done in Spain and Portugal; but besides, as it would have
been necessary to confine itself to the second inspiration in
a style already secondary, the spirit of the nation, sufficiently
well represented by that of Ronsard, foreseeing from afar
its high destinies, wished to command the summit of
Parnassus, before having discovered the first paths.</p>

<p>The disasters of the first epic poets did not discourage
their successors; vying with each other they sought to make
amends; but instead of seeing the obstacle where it really
was, that is to say, in the incompatible alliance of the essence
of Epopœia with the form of romance, they imagined
that lack of talent alone had been prejudicial to the success
of their predecessors. Consequently they devoted themselves
to work with an indefatigable ardour, polishing
and repolishing the rhyme, tearing to pieces and revising
twenty times their works, and finally bringing the form to
the highest perfection that they were able to attain. The
century of Louis XIV., so fertile in able versifiers, in profound
rhymers, saw, however, the dawn of Epic poems only
as a signal of their failure. Chapelain had, nevertheless,
shown talent before his catastrophe; wishing to interest
the French nation, he had chosen in its history the sole epic
subject which he found there. Why had he not succeeded?
This point was considered, and the truth still lacking, they
went on to imagine that the fault was inherent in the French
tongue, and that it was no longer capable of rising to the
heights of Epopœia: deplorable error, which for a long time
has been harmful to the development of a tongue destined
to become universal and to carry to future centuries the
discoveries of past ones.</p>

<p>Ronsard had felt the difficulty most. Accustomed as
he was to read Greek and Latin works in the original, he
had seen clearly that what prevented the French tongue from
following their poetic movement was particularly the restraint
of the rhyme; he had even sought to free it from this
servitude, endeavouring to make the French verses scan
according to the ancient rhythm; but, in another way he
had not appreciated the genius of that tongue which refused
to follow this rhythm. Jodelle, Baïf, Passerat, Desportes,
Henri-Etienne, and certain other savants, have made at
different times the same attempt, and always without
results.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>
Each tongue has its own character which it is
necessary to know; ours has not at all the musical prosody
of the Greek and Latin; its syllables are not determined,
long and short, by the simple duration of time, but by the
different accentuation and inflection of the voice. Among
our writers the one who has best understood the nature of
this prosody is certainly the abbé d’Olivet: he declared firstly
that he did not believe it possible to make French verses
measured by rhythm; and secondly, that even in the case
where this might be possible, he did not see how this rhythm
could be conformable to that of the Greeks and
Latins.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>I am absolutely of his opinion on these two points; I
am furthermore, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(en partie)</i>, on what he says of the rhyme.
I know as he, that it is not an invention of the barbarous
ages; I know even more, that it is the luxurious production
of a very enlightened age; I must say that it has brought
forth thousands of beautiful verses, that it is often to the
poet like a strange genius which comes to the assistance of
his own.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
God forbid that I pretend to separate it from
French verse of which it is a charm. Rhyme is necessary,
even indispensable, to romantic poetry and to all that is
derived from it; and songs, ballads, vaudevilles, sylves of
whatever sort they may be, whatever form, whatever length
they may have, cannot pass away. It adds an infinite
grace to all that is sung or recited with the chivalrous sentiment.
Even the lyric style receives from it a romantic
harmony which accords with it. All the secondary styles
admit of this. It can, up to a certain point, embellish descriptive
verse, soften didactic verse, add to the melancholy
of the elegy, to the grace of the idyl; it can at last become the
ornament of dramatic art such as we possess&mdash;&#8203;that is to say,
chivalrous and impassioned; but as to real Eumolpœia and
Epopœia&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, as to what concerns intellectual
and rational poetry, pure or mingled with the enthusiasm
of the passions; prophetic verses or hymns, emanated from
the Divinity or destined to be raised to it; philosophical
verse adapted to the nature of things and developing the
diverse moral and physical systems; epic verses uniting
talent to allegorical genius and joining together the intelligible
world to the sentient world; with all these, rhyme is
incompatible. As much as it delights in works of the mind
just so much is it rejected by genius. Fiction harmonizes
with it, allegory is opposed to it. It is chivalrous and not
heroic; agreeable, brilliant, clever, melancholy, sentimental,
but it could never be either profound or sublime.</p>

<p>Let us clear this up with the light of experience, and
now that we can do it to good purpose, let us make a rapid
survey of the poetic condition of the principal nations of
the earth.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Section Six">§ VI</abbr></p>

<p>The Greeks and the Romans, as guilty of ingratitude
as of injustice, have styled Asia barbarous, without
thinking that they thus outraged their Mother, the one
from whom both had their origin and their first instructions.
Europe, more impartial today, begins to feel as she should
toward this ancient and noble country, and rendering to her
venerable scars a filial respect, does not judge her according
to her present weakness, but according to the vigour that
she possessed in the age of her strength, and of which her
magnificent productions still bear the imprint. A philosophical
observer, academician of Calcutta, turning an
investigating eye upon that part of the terrestrial continent,
has recognized there five principal nations, among which
that of the Indians holds the first rank; the others are those
of the Chinese, Tartars, Persians, and
Arabs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
According to
this able writer, primitive India should be considered as a
sort of luminous focus which, concentrating at a very remote
epoch the learning acquired by an earlier people, has reflected
it, and has dispersed the rays upon the neighbouring
nations.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
She has been the source of Egyptian, Greek, and
Latin theogony; she has furnished the philosophical dogmas
with which the first poets of Thrace and Ionia have adorned
the beauties of Eumolpœia and Epopœia; it is she who has
polished the Persians, Chaldeans, Arabs, and Ethiopians;
and who by her numerous colonies has entertained relations
with the Chinese, Japanese, Scandinavians, Celts, Etruscans,
and even with the Peruvians of the other
hemisphere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>If one listens to the discourse of those who have been
much inclined to study the savant language of the Indians,
Sanskrit, he will be persuaded that it is the most perfect
language that man has ever spoken. Nothing, according
to them, can surpass its riches, its fertility, its admirable
structure; it is the source of the most poetic conceptions
and the mother of all the dialects which are in use from the
Persian Gulf to the waters of
China.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
It is certain that if
anything can prove to the eyes of savants the maternal
rights that this tongue claims over all the others, it is the
astonishing variety of its poetry: what other peoples possess
in detail, it possesses <i>in toto</i>. It is there that Eumolpœia,
Epopœia, and Dramatic Art shine with native <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i>: it is
there that poetry divine and rational, poetry allegorical and
passionate, poetry stirring and even romantic, find their
cradle. There, all forms are admitted, all kinds of verse
received. The <cite>Vedas</cite>, pre-eminently sacred books, are,
like the Koran of Mohammed, written in cadenced
prose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span>
The <cite>Pouranas</cite>, which contain the theosophy and philosophy
of the Brahmans, their system concerning Nature, their
ideas upon morals and upon natural philosophy, are composed
in philosophical verse not rhymed; they are attributed
to Vyasa, the Orpheus of the Indians. Valmiki, who is their
Homer, has displayed in the <cite>Ramayana</cite> an epopœia magnificent
and sublime to the highest degree; the dramas, which
they call Nataks, are, according to their style, rhymed and
not rhymed: Bheret is considered as their inventor; Kalidasa
as their perfecter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span>
The other kinds of poetry are all
rhymed; their number is immense; their variety infinite.
Nothing equals the industry and delicacy of the Indian
rhymers in this style. The Arabs all skilful as they were,
the Oscan troubadours whose rhyme was their sole merit,
have never approached their
models.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
Thus, not only does
one find among the Indians the measured verse of the
Greeks and Romans, not only does one see there rhythms
unknown to these two peoples, but one recognizes also
there our rhyme with combinations of which we have
no idea.</p>

<p>I ought to make an important observation here: it is,
that whereas India, mistress of Asia, held the sceptre of the
earth, she still recognized only the eumolpœia of the <cite>Vedas</cite>
and the <cite>Pouranas</cite>, only the epopœia of <cite>Maha-Bharata</cite> and
the <cite>Ramayana</cite>; her poetry was the language of the gods
and she gave herself the name of <cite>Ponya-Rhoumi</cite>, Land of
Virtues. It was only when a long prosperity had enervated
her, that the love for novelty, the caprice of fashion and
perhaps, as it happened in Greece, the deviation of the
theatre, caused her to seek for beauties foreign to veritable
poetry. It is not a rare thing to pass the point of perfection
when one has attained it. The astonishing flexibility of
Sanskrit, the abundance of its final consonants opens a
double means for corruption. Poets multiplied words
believing to multiply ideas; they doubled rhymes; they
tripled them in the same verse believing to increase proportionably
its harmony. Their imagination bending before
an inspiring genius became vagabond; they thought to
rise to the sublime, and fell into the bombastic. At last,
knowing no longer how to give emphasis and importance
to their extravagant thoughts, they created words
of such length that, in order to contain them, it was
necessary to forge verses of four <i>cæsuras</i> of nineteen
syllables each.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, therefore, at the epoch of the decadence of the
Indian Empire, that rhyme usurped poetry. It would be
difficult today to say whether it was an innovation or a
simple renovation. However it may be, it is probable that
it passed rapidly from the ruling nation to subject nations
where it was diversely welcomed according to the language
and particular mind of each people.</p>

<p>If one can believe the annals of the Indians, China was
one of their colonies for a long time schismatic and
rebellious.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
If one can lend faith to the most ancient tradition of the
Chinese, they form from time immemorial a body of autochthonous
people.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>
The discussion of this historic difficulty
would be out of place here. Suffice it to say, that the Chinese
having commenced by having rhymed verses, and preserving
by character and by religion, with an inviolable respect,
the ancient usages, have never had but a mediocre poetry,
absolutely foreign to
epopœia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span>
Their principal sacred
books, called <cite>Kings</cite>, are composed of symbolic or hieroglyphic
characters, forming by groups sorts of tableaux, of profound
and often sublime conception, but bereft of what we would
call eloquence of language. These are mute images, incommunicable
by means of the voice, and which the reader
must consider with the eyes and meditate long upon in order
to comprehend them.</p>

<p>The Tartars who reign today in China and who are
distinguished from the others by the epithet of Manchus,
although possessors of a formed tongue whose richness
certain authors praise,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span>
have not any kind of poetry as I
have already remarked.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span>
The other Tartars were hardly
more advanced before being placed by their conquests
within reach of the learning of the vanquished people.
The Turks had no alphabetical characters. The Huns
were ignorant even of its existence. The proud vanquisher
of Asia, Genghis Khan did not find, according to the best
historians, a single man among the Mongolians capable of
writing his despatches. The alphabet of fourteen letters
that the Uïgurian Tartars possess, appears to have been
given them by the ancient Persians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>
from whom they also
received the little that they knew of poetry.</p>

<p>These Persians, today imitators of the Arabs, were in
very remote times disciples of the Indians. Their sacred
tongue then called Zend, in which are written the fragments
that remain to us of Zoroaster, was a dialect of
Sanskrit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span>
These fragments that we owe to the indefatigable zeal of
Anquetil Duperron, appear to be written, as the Vedas, or
as all the sacred books of India, in cadenced prose. After
the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, the most famous book among the Parsees
is the <cite>Boun-Dehesh</cite>, written in Pehlevi, and containing the
cosmogony of Zoroaster. Pehlevi, which is derived from
Chaldaic Nabatæan, indicates a
translation,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
and testifies
that Persia had already passed from under the dominion
of India to that of Assyria. But when, thanks to the conquests
of Cyrus, Persia had become free and mistress of
Asia, Pehlevi, which recalled its ancient servitude, was
banished from the court by Bahman-Espandiar, whom we
call Artaxerxes
Longimanus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
The Parsee replaced it;
this last dialect, modified by Greek under the successors of
Alexander, mixed with many Tartar words under the Parthian
kings, polished by the Sassanidæ, usurped at last by
the Arabs and subjected to the intolerant influence of Islamism,
had no longer its own character: it has taken, in the
modern Persian, all the movements of the Arabic, notwithstanding
its slight analogy with
it<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>;
following its
example, it has concentrated all the beauties of poetry in
rhyme and since then it has had neither Eumolpœia nor
Epopœia.</p>

<p>As to the Arab, no one is ignorant of the degree to which
he is a slave to rhyme. Already, by a sufficiently happy
conjecture, a French writer had made the first use of rhyme
in France coincide with the irruption of the Moors into
Europe at the beginning of the eighth
century.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
He has
said that Provence had been the door by which this novelty
was introduced into France. However difficult it may
appear of proving rigorously this assertion, lacking monuments,
it cannot, however, be denied that it may be very
probable, above all considering what influence the Arabs
exercised upon the sciences and arts in the south of France
after they had penetrated through Spain. Now, there is
no country on earth where the poetry that I have called
romantic has been cultivated with more constancy and
success than in Arabia; rhyme, if she has received it from
India, was naturalized there by long usage, in such a way
as to appear to have had birth there. If it must be said,
the Arab tongue seems more apt at receiving it than the
Sanskrit. Rhyme seems more requisite to poetry there,
on account of the great quantity and inflexibility of the
monosyllables, which joining together only with much
difficulty to form the numerous and rhythmic combinations,
had need of its assistance to soften their harshness and to
supply the harmony which they lacked.</p>

<p>Neverthless, whatever may be the pretension of Arabia
to the invention of rhyme, and even to that of romantic
poetry, one cannot be prevented, when one possesses without
prejudice and to a certain extent the distinguishing
character of the Asiatic languages, from seeing that there
are proofs in the Arabic itself which give evidence in favour
of India. Such is, for example, the word
<i>Diwan</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span>
by which
the Arabs designate the collection of their ancient
poetries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
This word, which is attached to the Sanskrit expression
<i>Dewa</i> or <i>Diwa</i>, designates all that is divine, celestial; all
that emanates from the Universal
Intelligence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span>:
it is the
poetry of the Greeks, the language of the gods, or the voice
of the Universal Being of the Egyptians and the Phœnicians.</p>

<p>However, the Arabic <i>Diwan</i>--that is to say, the poetic
collection of that nation, goes back to most ancient times.
One finds in it verses attributed to the first Hebrew patriarchs
and even to Adam<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>;
for since the introduction of
Islamism, the cosmogony of Moses has become that of the
Mussulmans, as it has been ours since the establishment of
Christianity. It is there, in this <dfn>diwan</dfn>, that the most
authentic traditions are preserved: they are all in verse
and resemble greatly, as to form and doubtless as to substance,
that which the monk of St. André has transmitted
to us through the court of Charlemagne. It is the same
chivalrous spirit and the same romantic fictions. The
Persian poet Firdausi appears to have followed similar
traditions concerning the ancient kings of Iran, in his famous
poem entitled
<cite>Shah-Namah</cite>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
The wonders which reign
in these traditions have been transmitted no doubt by the
Arabs, with the artifice of rhyme: both have the same spirit.
The protecting fairies of the knights, the giant persecutors
of ladies, the enchanters, the magic, and all those illusions
are the fruits of that brilliant and dreamy imagination which
characterizes the modern Orientals. We have enthusiastically
enjoyed them in the depths of the barbarity where we
were plunged; we have allowed ourselves to be drawn by
the charms of rhyme, like children in the cradle, whom their
nurses put to sleep by the monotonous sound of a lullaby.
Escaped from that state of languor, and struck at last with
a gleam of real intelligence, we have compared Greece and
Arabia, the songs of epopœia and those of the ballads; we
have blushed at our choice; we have wished to change it;
but owing to the captivating form always more or less the
substance, we have only succeeded in making mixtures
more or less happy, according to the secondary mode that
we follow.</p>

<p>Rhyme, brought into Europe by the Arabs more than
a thousand years ago, spread by degrees among all nations,
in such a way that when one wishes to examine its origin
with accuracy, one no longer knows whether it is indigenous
there or exotic. One finds on all sides only rhymed verses.
The Spanish, Portuguese, Italians, French, Germans of all
dialects, Hollanders, Danes, Swedes and Norwegians, all
rhyme.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
The modern Greeks themselves have forgotten
their ancient rhythm in order to assume our
style.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
If
anything could, however, make one doubt that rhyme may
be natural to Europe, it is that ancient Scandinavian, in
which are written the precious fragments which have come
down to us concerning the mythological cult of the Celts,
our ancestors, does not rhyme; also it rises often to the
sublimity of Eumolpœia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
This observation, which makes
us reject Arabia, will take us back to India, if we consider
that there is plausible presumption in believing that the
Phœnicians and the Egyptians who had so much intercourse
with the Arabs, did not rhyme, since the sacred book of
the Hebrews, the <cite>Sepher</cite>, that we call the <cite>Bible</cite>, and which
appears to have issued from the Egyptian sanctuaries, is
written in cadenced rhyme, as the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite> of the Parsees
and the <cite>Vedas</cite> of the
Indians.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The outline that I have just sketched confirms, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>,
what I have wished to prove to you and which is the subject
of this discourse, the distinction that should be made
between the essence and the form of poetry, and the reciprocal
influence that should be recognized between these
two parts of the science. You have seen that wherever
rhyme has dominated exclusively, as in Asia among the
Chinese, Arabians, Persians; as in Europe among all the
modern peoples, it has excluded epopœia and has replaced
allegorical genius by the spirit of romantic fictions; you
have seen that wherever eumolpique poetry has wished to
appear, whether moral or rational, theosophical or philosophical,
it has been obliged to have recourse to a particular
prose, when the form of poetry has resisted it, as has happened
in China for the <cite>Kings</cite>, in Persia for the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>,
in Arabia for the <cite>Koran</cite>; you have seen that wherever
poetry has been preserved purely rhythmical, as in Greece
and with the Romans, it has admitted eumolpœia and epopœia
without mixture; and finally, that wherever the two
forms meet each other with all their modifications, as in
India, it gives way in turn to all the different kinds, intellectual
and rational, epic, dramatic, and romantic.</p>

<p>Now, what Hindustan was for Asia, France should be
for Europe. The French tongue, as the Sanskrit, should
tend towards universality; it should be enriched with all
the learning acquired in the past centuries, so as to transmit
it to future generations. Destined to float upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(débris)</i>
of a hundred different dialects, it ought to be able to save
from the shipwreck of time all their beauties and all their
remarkable productions. Nevertheless, how will it be
done, if its poetic forms are not open to the spirit of all
the poetries, if its movement, arrested by obstacles cannot
equal that of the tongues which have preceded it in the
same career? By what means, I ask you, will it succeed
to the universal dominion of Sanskrit, if, dragging always
after it the frivolous jingling of Arabic sounds, it cannot
even succeed to the partial domination of Greek or Latin?
Must it be necessary then that it betray its high destinies,
and that the providential decree which founds the European
empire, exempt it from the glory which it promises to the
French name?</p>

<p>I have told you, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, in beginning this discourse,
that it was in the interest of science alone, that I entered
this career: it is assuredly not by my poor poetic talent that
I have aspired to the honour of occupying your attention;
but by a generous instinct, which, making me ignore many
of the considerations which might have arrested me, has
persuaded me that I could be useful. I have dared to conceive
the possibility of composing, in French, eumolpique
verse, which might neither be measured by musical rhythm
foreign to our tongue, nor enchained by rhyme opposed to
all intellectual and rational movement, and which however
might have neither the harshness, nor the discord of that
which has been called, up to this time, blank verse.</p>

<p>Many French writers have tried to make verse deprived
of rhyme. Some have sought to imitate the measures of
the ancients, others have satisfied themselves with copying
certain moderns who do not rhyme. Each of them has
misunderstood the essential character of his tongue. Vossius
alone appears to have foreseen the principles without
developing them, when he has said that French verse might
be considered as having only one
foot.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
This is exactly
true in examining rhythm only in itself, and giving to each
hemistich the name of time: but if one considers this one
foot, whether hexameter or pentameter, as formed of two
times equal or unequal, it is perceived that it participates,
through its final, in two natures: the one strong and forceful,
that we name masculine; the other soft and languid,
that we call feminine. Therefore, French verse having but
one rhythmic foot, differs, however, in the style of this foot
and can be considered in two relations. Let us take for
example the hexameter verse. The rhythmic foot which
constitutes it is composed of two equal times distinguished
by the cæsura, the last of which is masculine or feminine:
Masculine, as in:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Rome, l’unique objet de mon ressentiment!</div>
<div class="i0">Rome, à qui vient ton bras d’immoler mon amant!</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Feminine, as in:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Rome qui t’a vu naître et que ton cœur adore!</div>
<div class="i0">Rome enfin que je hais parce qu’elle t’honore!</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In rhymed verses, such as these I have just cited, two
feet of the same kind are obliged to follow one another on
account of the rhyme which links them; they then form but
one whole and, proceeding abreast without being separated,
they injure by their forced mass the rapidity of expression
and flight of thought. If a third foot of the same kind
occur with the other two feet, rhyming together, it would
have to rhyme with them to prevent an insupportable discordance,
which is not tolerated; a fourth or a fifth foot would
submit to the same law, so that, if the poet wished to fill
his piece with masculine verses alone, it would be necessary
that he should make them proceed upon a single rhyme, as
the Arabs do today and as our early troubadours did,
following their example. The French poet can vary his
rhyme only by varying the style of his verses and by mingling
alternately together the masculine and feminine finals.</p>

<p>As these two kinds of finals are dissimilar without being
opposed, they may be brought together without the need
of rhyming; their meeting, far from being disagreeable is,
on the contrary, only pleasing; two finals of the same kind,
whether masculine or feminine, can never clash without
causing the same sound&mdash;&#8203;that is, without rhyming; but it is
not thus with the finals of different kinds, since the rhyme is
impossible in this case. So that, to make what I call eumolpique
verses, it suffices to avoid the meeting of finals of the
same kind, whose impact necessitates the rhyme, by making
one kind succeed another continually, and opposing alternately
the masculine and feminine, the mingling of which is
irrelevant to eumolpœia. Here is all the mechanism of my
verses: they are fluent as to form; as to the essence which is
expedient for them&mdash;&#8203;that is another thing: for it is rarely
encountered.</p>

<p>Those who have made blank verse in French have
spoken justly of it with the greatest contempt; these verses,
miserable as to substance, without poetic fire, written as the
flattest prose, lacking movement and grace, had, furthermore,
the insupportable fault of not recognizing the genius
of the French tongue, by making finals of the same kind
clash constantly, and by not distinguishing that which is
called rhyme from that which repels it.</p>

<p>Now that I have made as clear as possible my motives
and my means, there remains only, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, for me to
submit to your judgment the translation that I have made,
in eumolpique verse, of the piece of Greek poetry which
comprises the doctrine of Pythagoras in seventy-one lines
called, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(par excellence)</i>, Golden Verses. This piece, venerable
by its antiquity and by the celebrated philosopher whose
name it bears, belonging to eumolpœia, without any mixture
of passion, is sufficiently known to savants so that I need
not speak about what concerns its particular merit. This
would mean, moreover, a matter of some explanations.
At any rate, I believe it advisable before passing to this
final subject, to give you certain examples of the use of my
verses as applied to epopœia, so that you may judge, since
they are in hands as incapable as mine, what they might
become when used by men of superior genius and talent.
I will choose, for this purpose, the exposition and invocation
of the principal epic poems of Europe, in order to have a
fixed subject for comparison. I will translate line by line,
and will imitate, as well as is possible for me, the movement
and harmony of the poet that I may have before me. This
labour, which I hope will not be without some interest for
the illustrious academicians whom I am addressing, will
furnish me the occasion of showing by certain characteristic
traits the genius of the language and poetry of the different
modern peoples of Europe; and I will terminate thus the
outline that I have sketched touching the poetic conditions
of the principal nations of the earth.

<p>I am beginning with the creator of epopœia, with Homer.
It is easy to see by the manner in which this divine man
blends, from the opening lines of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, the exposition and
invocation, that, full of a celestial inspiration that he was
the first to receive, he seeks to pour forth the superabundant
fire which consumes him, and to throw into the soul
of his hearer the impassioned enthusiasm which masters
and controls his own. The following lines will suffice
to make known the subject of a work which fills twenty-four
cantos.</p>

<p class="p2">I dispense with making any reflection upon the charm
of the original verses and upon the admirable sentiment
which terminates them. It would be a very strange thing
not to be impressed by the beauties of this poetry. Let
us pass on to Vergil.</p>

<p>Even though I should not say it, it would suffice now
to compare the Greek poet with the Latin poet, in order to
perceive that the latter received only a second inspiration,
transmitted by the inspiring power of the former. Vergil,
less ardent, more tender, more correct, admits at once the
luminous distinction; far from blending the exposition and
invocation, he separates them, affects a tone more simple,
promises little, exposes with timidity the subject of his
poem, summons his Muse, and seems to persuade it, even
less than the reader, to be favourable to him. He employs
these lines:</p>

<p class="p2">It can be observed that Vergil, although he places himself
foremost and although he says, <cite>I sing</cite>, begins nevertheless
in a manner much less animated, much less sure than
the Greek poet, who, transported beyond himself, seems to
impose upon his Muse the subject of his songs, interrogates
her, and then inspired by her, responds. The Latin poet
finishes, like his model, with a sentence; but it is easy to feel
that this apostrophe,</p>

<p>The talent of Homer shows itself completely in the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>; it dominates the genius there, so to speak, as much
as the genius had dominated it in the <cite>Iliad</cite>. The fire which
animates the <cite>Iliad</cite> has been, with reason, compared to that
of the sun arrived at the height of its course, and the splendour
which shines in the <cite>Odyssey</cite> to that with which the
occident is coloured on the evening of a fine day. Perhaps
if we had his <cite>Thebaid</cite>, we would see those brilliant lights
which accompany the aurora, developed there, and then
we would possess in all its shades this immortal genius who
depicted all nature.</p>

<p>There are people who, feeling by a sort of intuition that
Homer had been created the poetic incentive of Europe,
even as I have said, and judging on the other hand that
Ariosto had made an epic poem, are convinced that the
Italian poet had copied the Greek; but this is not so. Ariosto,
who has made only a romanesque poem, has not received
the inspiration of Homer; he has simply followed the
fictions attributed to Archbishop Turpin and clothing them
with forms borrowed from the Arabs by the troubadours
makes himself creator in this secondary style. The rhyme
is as essential to it as it is harmful to veritable epopœia; this
is why the eumolpique verses never conform to it in the
slightest degree. To apply them to it, is to make serious
what is by nature gay, it is to give a character of force and
of truth to what is only light, airy, and fantastic. I am
about, however, to translate the beginning of his poem, in
order to furnish, by the shocking disparity which exists
between the romantic essence of his poetry and the epic form
that I here adapt, a new proof of what I have said.</p>

<p class="p2">It is very easy to see, in reading these two strophes,
that there exists in the exposition no sort of resemblance
either with that of Homer, or with that of Vergil. It is a
third style, wholly foreign to the other two. Homer mingling
the exposition and the invocation, commands his Muse
to sing what she inspires in him; Vergil distinguishing one
from the other, prays his Muse to acquaint him with what
he is about to sing; whereas Ariosto, announcing simply
the subject of his songs, makes no invocation. It is evident
that he relies upon himself, and that in the style that
he adopts he understands very well that he has no other
Muse, no other guide than his imagination. His subject
is in accord with his manner of treating it. If one wishes to
reflect upon this decisive point, one will feel and realize,
for the first time perhaps, why in the opinion of all the
world concerning two works from the same hand, <cite>La Pucelle</cite>
and <cite>La Henriade</cite>, the one is a poem, whereas the other, composed
with a far greater pretension, is not. Voltaire, in
imitating Ariosto in a subject that he has rendered romanesque
and frivolous, has received the second inspiration; but
in imitating Lucan in an historic subject he received nothing,
for Lucan, creator of a mixed style, had no inspiration that
he could communicate.</p>

<p>I have said what I thought of Camoens: it is useless to
quote the exposition of his poem that has nothing remarkable,
particularly since Tasso has so far surpassed him.</p>

<p>Tasso was worthy of receiving a veritable inspiration.
His lofty genius, his pure and brilliant imagination brought
him nearer to Vergil than to Ariosto; and if he had been
inspired even through the Latin poet, he would have shown
Europe what the magnetic power of Homer was, although
acting only in its third degree. But the prejudices of education
working in him even without his knowledge, and the
influence that chivalresque poetry had attained in Italy,
did not permit him either to forsake entirely the chronicles
of Archbishop Turpin, or above all, to make any changes in
the consecrated form. All that he could do in a most
grave and serious historical subject was to mix a little allegorical
genius with a great deal of romanesque fiction; so
that, becoming inspired at the same time with Ariosto,
Lucan, and Vergil, he made a mixed work, which, under the
form of a lengthy song, contained the essence of epopœia,
of history, and of romance. This work is one of the most
entertaining poems that one can read; the only one perhaps
which a translation in prose can harm but little. The inequality
of its texture takes away nothing from the interest
that it inspires. It pleases, but it does not instruct. If
the eumolpique lines were applied to it throughout, it would
not sustain them; for it is in substance only a very beautiful
ballad; nevertheless, here and there are found parts
which could become sublime. His exposition, imitating
Vergil, reveals them very well. They are as follows:</p>

<p class="p2">The captivating enthusiasm of Homer, the majestic
simplicity of Vergil are not there; there is a sweetness of
expression, a purity of imagery which please. This might
be greater, but then the melancholy of the romance would
exclude it and the reader would demand the full force of
epopœia.</p>

<p>Besides, the Italians have tried, over and over again, to
vary the form of their verses; some have wished to measure
them by musical rhythm; others have contented themselves
with making blank verse. They have neither succeeded
completely nor failed completely. Their language sweet
and musical lacks force whether in good or in evil. Its
words might indeed, strictly speaking, be composed of long
and short syllables; but as they terminate, nearly all, in
the soft and languid style that we call feminine, it results,
therefore, that in the measured verses the poets lack the
long syllables to constitute the last foot and to form the
spondee; and that in the blank verse they are obliged to
terminate them all in the same style; so that with the measure
they create only lame verses, and without the rhyme
they make them all equally
languid.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>I recall having sometimes read French writers who,
not having investigated the character of their tongue, have
reproached it for its feminine syllables and have believed
that their concurrence was harmful to its force and its harmony.
These writers have scarcely considered what this
language would be, deprived of its feminine sounds. For
with the little force that it would gain on one side, it would
acquire such a harshness on the other, that it would be
impossible to draw from it four consecutive lines that would
be endurable. If all its finals were masculine, and if nothing
could change it otherwise, it would be necessary to renounce
poetry, or like the Arabs, be resolved to compose whole
poems in the same rhyme.</p>

<p>We have just seen that the lack of masculine finals
takes away all energy from the Italian tongue; a contrary
defect would deprive the French of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(mélange)</i> of sweetness
and force which makes it the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(première langue)</i> of
Europe. The English language is lacking in precisely
what the writers of whom I have spoken desired eliminated
from the French, without foreseeing the grave
disadvantages of their desire: it has no feminine
finals<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>;

also it is in everything the opposite of the Italian. It
is true that it possesses great energy, great boldness of
expression, and a grammatical liberty which goes to
the full extent; but deprived of sweetness and softness, it
is, if I may say it, like those brittle metals whose strength
is in stiffness, and which is broken when one would make
them flexible. The poverty of its rhymes, denuded for
the most part of accuracy of accent and of harmony in
consonants, has for a long time engaged the English poets
in making blank verse; and it must be admitted that, notwithstanding
the defect inherent in their tongue and which
consists, as I have just said, in the absolute lack of feminine
finals, they have succeeded in this better than any of the
poets of other nations. These lines, all imperfect in their
harmony, are however, as to form, the only eumolpique
verse that they could make. Shakespeare felt it and made
use of it in his tragedies.</p>

<p>Shakespeare with the creative genius with which nature
had endowed him, would have borne dramatic art to its
perfection in these modern times, if circumstances had been
as favourable to him as they were adverse. Emulator of
Æschylus, he might have equalled and perhaps surpassed
him, if he had had at his disposal a mine so rich, so brilliant
as that of the mysteries of Orpheus; if he had made use of
a language so harmonious, if his taste had been able to be
refined at the school of Pindar or of Homer. At the epoch
of his birth, Europe scarcely emerged from the gloom of
barbarism; the theatre, given over to ridiculous mountebanks,
profaned in indecent farces the incomprehensible
mysteries of the Christian religion, and the English tongue,
still crude and unformed, had not succeeded in amalgamating
in one single body the opposed dialects of which it was
successively formed. In spite of these obstacles, Shakespeare
stamped upon England a movement of which Europe
felt the influence. Raised by the sole force of his genius to
the essence of dramatic poetry, he dared to seek for his
subjects in the mythology of Odin, and put upon the stage,
in <cite>Hamlet</cite> and in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, tableaux of the highest
character.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>

Like Æschylus he conducted one to virtue by terror; but
unfortunately the taste of the spectators, upon which he
was forced to model his, led him to degrade his tableaux
by grotesque figures: the English people were not sufficiently
advanced to comprehend the moral end of the tragedy.
They must be amused; and Shakespeare succeeded only at
the expense of the beauties of the art. Historic facts and
trivial scenes replaced the mysterious and sublime subjects.</p>

<p>In London, the dramatic muse was turbulent and licentious;
as in Madrid it had been chivalrous and gallant.
Everywhere the theatre had to accommodate itself to the
taste of the people. The first regular tragedy which Pierre
Corneille composed in France was derived from a Spanish
ballad. Madrid at that time gave the tone to Europe.
It needed much of the time and all the prosperity of Louis
XIV. to throw off the unseasonable ascendancy that this
proud nation had assumed over public
opinion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
Notwithstanding
the efforts of Corneille, of Racine, and of
Molière, the Théâtre Français retained always the romanesque
tone that it had originally received. All that these
three men could do was, by lofty sentiments, by purity of
forms, by regularity of the customs and characters, to pass
over what was, in reality, defective. They came thus to
give to modern dramatic art all the perfection of which it
was susceptible. Shakespeare had been in London the
successor of Æschylus; Corneille received in France the
inspiration of Sophocles; Racine, that of Euripides; and
Molière united as in a sheaf the spirit of Menander, of
Terence, and of Plautus.</p>

<p>When I compare Shakespeare with Æschylus, I want
to make it clearly understood that I regard him as the regenerator
of the theatre in Europe, and superior to Corneille
and Racine as to dramatic essence, although he may be
assuredly much inferior to them as to form. Æschylus,
in Greek, was inspired by Homer; while, on the contrary, it
was Shakespeare who inspired Milton. It is known that
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite> was at first conceived as the subject of a
tragedy, and that it was only after reflection that the English
poet saw therein the material for an epic poem. I will
tell later on, in speaking of the <cite>Messiah</cite> of Klopstock, what
has prevented these two subjects, which appear equally
epics, from attaining wholly to the majesty of epopœia.
As many of the motives that I have to offer apply to the
two works, I will thus avoid useless repetition. I shall
begin by translating the exposition and invocation of Milton,
by imitating its movement and its harmony, as I have done
with the other poets.</p>

<p>This invocation is manifestly in imitation of Homer,
from whom Milton has received the second inspiration without
the intermediary&mdash;&#8203;Vergil. One can observe in the
English poet the same movement and almost as much
force as in the Greek poet, but much less clarity, precision,
and particularly harmony. Nearly all of these defects
pertain to his subject and his tongue. Circumstances
were not favourable to Milton. His lines could not have
been better with the elements that he was forced to employ.
All imperfect as they are, they are worth much more than
those of Klopstock; for at least they are in the character
of his tongue, whereas those of the German poet are not.
Milton is satisfied with throwing off the yoke of rhyme, and
has made eumolpique lines of one foot only, measured by
ten syllables. Their defect, inherent in the English idiom,
consists, as I have said, in having all the lines bearing equally
the masculine final, jarring continually one with the other.
Klopstock has aspired to make, in German, verses measured
by the musical rhythm of the Greeks; but he has not perceived
that he took as long and short, in his tongue, syllables
which were not such in musical rhythm, but by accent and
prosody, which is quite different. The German tongue,
composed of contracted words and consequently bristling
with consonants, bears no resemblance to the Greek, whose
words, abounding in vowels, were, on the contrary, made
clear by their elongation. The rhythmic lines of Klopstock
are materially a third longer than those of Homer,
although the German poet has aspired to build them on an
equal measure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
Their rhythmic harmony, if it exists
there, is absolutely factitious; it is a pedantic imitation and
nothing more. In order to make the movement of these
lines understood in French, and to copy as closely as possible
their harmony, it is necessary to compose lines of two
cæsuras, or what amounts to the same, to employ constantly
a line and a half to represent a single one. Here are the
first fourteen lines which contain the exposition and invocation
of the Messiah:</p>

<p>It is evident that in this exposition the movement of
Homer has been united by Klopstock to the ideas of Tasso.
The German poet claims nevertheless the originality, and
believes that he himself was called to enjoy the first inspiration.
In order that this high aspiration might have been
realized, a mass of learning very difficult to find would have
been necessary. I will explain briefly this idea. I believe
that the one who, disdaining to follow in the footsteps of
Homer or of Vergil, would wish to open another road to
epopœia, should be well acquainted with the ground over
which he ventures to trace it, and the goal toward which
he aspires to conduct it; I think he should make himself
master of his subject so that nothing might remain obscure
or unknown to him; so that if he should choose either the
downfall of Man, as Milton, or his rehabilitation, after the
example of Klopstock, he would be able to acquaint himself
with the inner meaning of these mysteries, to explain all the
conditions, to comprehend the beginning and the end, and,
raising himself to the intellectual nature where they had
birth, to spread light upon physical nature. This is the
first attainment that I deem indispensable to the epic poet;
I say that he should understand what he would sing. Homer
knew what Ilium was, what Ithaca was; he could explain
to himself the nature of Achilles and Helen, of Penelope and
Ulysses; consequently he could depict them. I do not wish
to investigate here whether Milton has understood in the
same manner the beginning of the World and the nature of
Satan; nor whether Klopstock has well understood the
mystery of the incarnation of the Messiah. I only say
that if they have not understood these things, they cannot
sing them in a manner really epic.</p>

<p>A defect which is common to these two poets, and which
is even noticeable in the <cite>Jerusalem Delivered</cite> of Tasso, is,
that everything which does not pertain to the part of the
celebrated hero, is by its impure, unfaithful, impious nature,
governed by the Principle of evil, and as such consigned to
eternal damnation. An insurmountable barrier separates
the personages and makes them not alone enemies, but
opposed, as much as good and evil, light and darkness.
However, the passions act unknown even to the poet; the
reader is hurried along, he forgets the fatal line of demarcation,
and is deceived into becoming interested in Satan,
into finding great, beautiful, and terrible, this enemy of
mankind; he trusts in Armida, he is moved by her troubles,
and seconds with his vows those of a notorious magician,
instrument of the Infernal Spirit. Matters go not thus
with Homer. The Greeks see in the Trojans, enemies,
and not reprobates. Paris is culpable but not impious.
Hector is a hero in whom one can be interested without
shame, and the interest that one devotes to him reflects
upon Achilles and can even be increased. The gods are
divided; but Venus and Juno, Minerva and Mars, Vulcan
and Neptune are of a like nature; and although divided in
the epic action, they are none the less venerated by both
parties, equal among each other and all equally subject to
Jupiter, who excites or checks their resentment. I know
not whether any one has already made this observation;
but be that as it may, it is very important. One can attain
to the sublimity of epopœia only if like Homer one knows
how to oppose the Powers which serve the hero with the
Powers which persecute him. For if everything which
serves the hero is good, holy, and sacred, and everything
which is harmful to him wicked, impious, and reprobate,
I do not see the glory of his triumph.</p>

<p>The principal defect in Milton’s poem is that his hero
succumbs, although he has to combat only the evil things
within himself, whilst everything which is good protects
him: the poem of Klopstock does not hold the reader’s interest,
because the perils of his hero are illusory and as soon
as he is represented as God, and when he himself knows his
divinity, his downfall is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>But it is too much to dwell upon points of criticism which
do not belong to my subject. I have touched upon them
only slightly so that you may feel, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, notwithstanding
the pretensions of three rival peoples, that the epic
career remains none the less wholly open to the French
nation. Some out-of-the-way paths have been traced here
and there; but no poet since Vergil, has left the imprint
of his steps upon the true path. The moment is perhaps at
hand for gathering the palms that time has ripened. Must
this century, great in prodigies, remain without an impassioned
and enchanting voice to sing of them? Assuredly
not. Whoever may be the poet whose genius raises itself
to this noble task, I have wished from afar to lend him my
feeble support; for I have often enough repeated, that
talent alone will aspire to this in vain. Epopœia will only
be the portion of the one who thoroughly understands the
essence of poetry and who is able to apply to it a proper
form. I have penetrated this essence as far as has been
possible for me, and I have revealed my ideas, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>,
as clearly as the insufficiency of my means has permitted.
I trust that their development may have appeared satisfactory
and useful to you; I trust equally that the new form
which I offer you merits your attention. I have applied
it before you, to ideas, to intentions and to very different
harmonies: it adapts itself here, for of itself it is nothing.
Subject wholly to poetic essence, it receives therefrom all its
lustre. If the ideas that it would render have grandeur and
sublimity, it will easily become grand and sublime; but
nothing would be poorer and more void, than that it should
serve trivial thoughts or that it should conceal an absolute
want of ideas. Do not imagine, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, that the absence
of rhyme makes easy the French verse; it is precisely
this absence which makes the great difficulty: for there is
not then the means of writing without thinking. One can,
with the aid of talent and practice, compose pleasing rhymed
verse, without a great expenditure of ideas; the enormous
quantity that is made today proves that it is not very
difficult. The elegance of form supplies the sterility of
substance. But this form becomes at last worn out; the
rhymes are not inexhaustible; one word attracts another,
forces it to unite with it, making understood the sounds
that one has heard a thousand times, repeating the pictures
which are everywhere; one repeats unceasingly the same
things: the enjambment which gives so much grace to the
Greek and Latin verse and without which real epic impulse
cannot exist, is opposed to the rhyme and destroys it. You
can see, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</i>, that it constitutes one of the principal
qualities of eumolpique verse; nothing here constrains the
enthusiasm of the poet.</p>

<p>After some impassioned verses that I have believed
necessary for you to hear, I shall now pass on to verses,
philosophical and devoid of passion, which form the subject
of this writing and to which I desire above all to call your
attention.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">EXAMINATIONS OF THE GOLDEN VERSES:
EXPLANATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS</h3>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<p class="center">EXAMINATIONS OF THE GOLDEN VERSES:<br />
EXPLANATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS</p>

<p class="p2 center">1. <span class="sc">The Golden Verses of the Pythagoreans</span></p>

<p class="dropcap negindent">THE ancients had the habit of comparing with gold all
that they deemed without defects and pre-eminently
beautiful: thus, by the <i>Golden Age</i> they understood, the age
of virtues and of happiness; and by the <i>Golden Verses</i>, the
verses wherein was concealed the most pure
doctrine.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>

They constantly attributed these Verses to Pythagoras,
not that they believed that this philosopher had himself
composed them, but because they knew that his disciple,
whose work they were, had revealed the exact doctrine of
his master and had based them all upon maxims issued from
his mouth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
This disciple, commendable through his
learning, and especially through his devotion to the precepts
of Pythagoras, was called
Lysis.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>
After the death
of this philosopher and while his enemies, momentarily
triumphant, had raised at Crotona and at Metaponte that
terrible persecution which cost the lives of so great a number
of Pythagoreans, crushed beneath the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(débris)</i> of their
burned school, or constrained to die of hunger in the temple
of the Muses,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
Lysis, happily escaped from these disasters,
retired into Greece, where, wishing to spread the sect of
Pythagoras, to whose principles calumnies had been attached,
he felt it necessary to set up a sort of formulary
which would contain the basis of morals and the principal
rules of conduct given by this celebrated man. It is to this
generous movement that we owe the philosophical verses
that I have essayed to translate into French. These verses,
called <i>golden</i> for the reason I have given, contain the sentiments
of Pythagoras and are all that remain to us, really
authentic, concerning one of the greatest men of antiquity.
Hierocles, who has transmitted them to us with a long and
masterly Commentary, assures us that they do not contain,
as one might believe, the sentiment of one in particular,
but the doctrine of all the sacred corps of Pythagoreans
and the voice of all the
assemblies.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
He adds that there
existed a law which prescribed that each one, every morning
upon rising and every evening upon retiring, should read
these verses as the oracles of the Pythagorean school. One
sees, in reality, by many passages from Cicero, Horace,
Seneca, and other writers worthy of belief, that this law
was still vigorously executed in their
time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
We know
by the testimony of Galen in his treatise on <cite>The Understanding
and the Cure of the Maladies of the Soul</cite>, that he himself
read every day, morning and evening, the Verses of Pythagoras;
and that, after having read them, he recited them by
heart. However, I must not neglect to say that Lysis,
who is the author of them, obtained so much celebrity in
Greece that he was honoured as the master and friend of
Epaminondas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
If his name has not been attached to
this work, it is because at the epoch when he wrote it, the
ancient custom still existed of considering things and not
individuals: it was with the doctrine of Pythagoras that
one was concerned, and not with the talent of Lysis which
had made it known. The disciples of a great man had no
other name than his. All their works were attributed to
him. This is an observation sufficiently important to make
and which explains how Vyasa in India, Hermes in Egypt,
Orpheus in Greece, have been the supposed authors of such
a multitude of books that the lives of many men would
not even suffice to read them.</p>

<p>In my translation, I have followed the Greek text, such
as is cited at the head of the Commentary of Hierocles, commentated
on by the son of Casaubon, and interpreted into
Latin by J. Curterius; London edition, 1673. This work,
like all those which remain to us of the ancients, has been
the subject of a great many critical and grammatical discussions:
in the first place one must before everything else be
assured of the material part. This part is today as authentic
and as correct as it is possible to be, and although there
exists still, several different readings, they are of too little
importance for me to dwell upon. It is not my affair and
besides, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(chacun doit faire son métier)</i>. That of the grammarian
has ended where it ought to end. For how can man
ever expect to advance if he never is willing to try some new
thing which is offered. I shall not therefore make any
criticizing remarks concerning the text, for I consider this
text sufficiently examined; neither will I make any notes
concerning the Commentaries, properly so-called, on these
seventy-one lines, for I think it is sufficient having those of
Hierocles, of Vitus Amerbachius, Theodore Marcilius,
Henri Brem, Michel Neander, Jean Straselius, Guilhaume
Diezius, Magnus-Daniel Omeis, André Dacier, etc. As I
stated, I shall make examinations rather than commentaries,
and I will give, regarding the inner meaning of the Verses,
all the explanations that I believe useful for their complete
development.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">2. <i>Render to the Immortal Gods the consecrated cult;<br />
    Guard then thy faith</i>:</p>

<p>Pythagoras, of whom a modern savant, otherwise most
estimable, has rather throughtlessly reproached with being
a fanatical and superstitious
man,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span>
begins his teaching,
nevertheless, by laying down a principle of universal tolerance.
He commands his disciples to follow the cult established
by the laws, whatever this cult may be, and to adore
the gods of their country, what ever these gods may be;
enjoining them only, to guard afterwards their faith&mdash;&#8203;that
is, to remain inwardly faithful to his doctrine, and never to
divulge the mysteries. Lysis, in writing these opening
lines, adroitly conceals herein a double meaning. By the
first he commended, as I have said, tolerance and reserve
for the Pythagorean, and, following the example of the
Egyptian priests, established two doctrines, the one apparent
and vulgar, conformable to the law; the other mysterious
and secret, analogous to the faith; by the second meaning,
he reassures the suspicious people of Greece, who, according
to the slanders which were in circulation might have feared
that the new sect would attack the sanctity of their gods.
This tolerance on the one hand, and this reserve on the other,
were no more than what they would be today. The Christian
Religion, exclusive and severe, has changed all our ideas
in this respect: by admitting only one sole doctrine in one
unique church, this religion has necessarily confused tolerance
with indifference or coldness, and reserve with heresy
or hypocrisy; but in the spirit of polytheism these same
things take on another colour. A Christian philosopher
could not, without perjuring himself and committing a
frightful impiety, bend the knee in China before <i>Kong-Tse</i>,
nor offer incense to <i>Chang-Ty</i> nor to <i>Tien</i>; he could neither
render, in India, homage to <i>Krishna</i>, nor present himself at
Benares as a worshipper of <i>Vishnu</i>; he could not even,
although recognizing the same God as the Jews and Mussulmans,
take part in their ceremonies, or what is still more,
worship this God with the Arians, the Lutherans, or Calvinists,
if he were a Catholic. This belongs to the very
essence of his cult. A Pythagorean philosopher did not
recognize in the least these formidable barriers, which hem
in the nations, as it were, isolate them, and make them worse
than enemies. The gods of the people were in his eyes the
same gods, and his cosmopolitan dogmas condemned no
one to eternal damnation. From one end of the earth to
the other he could cause incense to rise from the altar of
the Divinity, under whatever name, under whatever form it
might be worshipped, and render to it the public cult established
by the law. And this is the reason. Polytheism
was not in their opinion what it has become in ours, an
impious and gross idolatry, a cult inspired by the infernal
adversary to seduce men and to claim for itself the honours
which are due only to the Divinity; it was a particularization
of the Universal Being, a personification of its attributes
and its faculties. Before Moses, none of the theocratic
legislators had thought it well to present for the adoration
of the people, the Supreme God, unique and uncreated in
His unfathomable universality. The Indian Brahmans, who
can be considered as the living types of all the sages and of
all the pontiffs of the world, never permit themselves, even
in this day when their great age has effaced the traces of
their ancient science, to utter the name of God, principle of
All.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>
They are content to meditate upon its essence in
silence and to offer sacrifices to its sublimest emanations.
The Chinese sages act the same with regard to the Primal
Cause, that must be neither named nor
defined<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>;
the
followers of Zoroaster, who believe that the two universal
principles of good and evil, Ormuzd and Ahriman, emanate
from this ineffable Cause, are content to designate it under
the name of Eternity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
The Egyptians, so celebrated for
their wisdom, the extent of their learning, and the multitude
of their divine symbols, honoured with silence the
God, principle and source of all
things<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>;
they never spoke
of it, regarding it as inaccessible to all the researches of
man; and Orpheus, their disciple, first author of the brilliant
mythology of the Greeks, Orpheus, who seemed to announce
the soul of the World as creator of this same God from which
it emanated, said plainly:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I never see this Being surrounded with a
cloud.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Moses, as I have said, was the first who made a public
dogma of the unity of God, and who divulged what, up to
that time had been buried in the seclusion of the sanctuaries;
for the principal tenets of the mysteries, those upon which
reposed all others, were the Unity of God and the homogeneity
of Nature.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
It is true that Moses, in making this disclosure,
permitted no definition, no reflection, either upon the
essence or upon the nature of this unique Being; this is
very remarkable. Before him, in all the known world, and
after him (save in Judea where more than one cloud still
darkened the idea of divine Unity, until the establishment
of Christianity), the Divinity was considered by the theosophists
of all nations, under two relations: primarily as
unique, secondarily as infinite; as unique, preserved under
the seal of silence to the contemplation and meditation of
the sages; as infinite, delivered to the veneration and invocation
of the people. Now the unity of God resides in His
essence so that the vulgar can never in any way either
conceive or understand. His infinity consists in His perfections,
His faculties, His attributes, of which the vulgar
can, according to the measure of their understanding, grasp
some feeble emanations, and draw nearer to Him by detaching
them from the universality&mdash;&#8203;that is, by particularizing
and personifying them. This is the particularization and
the personification which constitutes, as I have said, polytheism.
The mass of gods which result from it, is as infinite
as the Divinity itself whence it had birth. Each nation,
each people, each city adopts at its liking, those of the divine
faculties which are best suited to its character and its requirements.
These faculties, represented by simulacra,
become so many particular gods whose variety of names
augments the number still further. Nothing can limit this
immense theogony, since the Primal Cause whence it emanates
has not done so. The vulgar, lured by the objects
which strike the senses, can become idolatrous, and he does
ordinarily; he can even distinguish these objects of his
adoration, one from another, and believe that there really
exist as many gods as statues; but the sage, the philosopher,
the most ordinary man of letters does not fall into this error.
He knows, with Plutarch, that different places and names
do not make different gods; that the Greeks and Barbarians,
the nations of the North and those of the South, adore the
same Divinity<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
he restores easily that infinity of attributes
to the unity of the essence, and as the honoured remnants
of the ancient Sramanas, the priests of the Burmans,
still do today, he worships God, whatever may be the
altar, the temple, and the place where he finds
himself.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>This is what was done by the disciples of Pythagoras, according
to the commandment of their master; they saw in
the gods of the nations, the attributes of the Ineffable Being
which were forbidden them to name; they augmented ostensibly
and without the slightest reluctance, the number of
these attributes of which they recognized the Infinite Cause;
they gave homage to the cult consecrated by the law and
brought them all back secretly to the Unity which was the
object of their faith.</p>

<p class="p2 center">3. … <i>Revere the memory<br />
Of the Illustrious Heroes, of Spirits demi-Gods.…</i></p>

<p>Pythagoras considered the Universe as an animated All,
whose members were the divine Intelligences, each ranked
according to its perfections, in its proper
sphere.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
He
it was who first designated this All, by the Greek word
<i>Kosmos</i>, in order to express the beauty, order, and regularity
which reigned there<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>;
the Latins translated this word by
<i>Mundus</i>, from which has come the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(monde)</i>.
It is from Unity considered as principle of the world, that
the name Universe which we give to it is derived. Pythagoras
establishes Unity as the principle of all things and
said that from this Unity sprang an infinite
Duality.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
The essence of this Unity, and the manner in which the
Duality that emanated from it was finally brought back
again, were the most profound mysteries of his doctrine;
the subject sacred to the faith of his disciples and the
fundamental points which were forbidden them to reveal.
Their explanation was never made in writing; those who
appeared worthy of learning them were content to be taught
them by word of mouth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
When one was forced, by the
concatenation of ideas, to mention them in the books of
the sect, symbols and ciphers were used, and the language
of Numbers employed; and these books, all obscure as they
were, were still concealed with the greatest care; by all
manner of means they were guarded against falling into
profane hands.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
I cannot enter into the discussion of
the famous symbol of Pythagoras, <em>one</em> and <em>two</em>, without
exceeding very much the limits that I have set down in
these examinations<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span>;
let it suffice for me to say, that as
he designated God by 1, and Matter by 2, he expressed the
Universe by the number 12, which results in the union of
the other two. This number is formed by the multiplication
of 3 by 4: that is to say, that this philosopher conceived
the Universal world as composed of three particular worlds,
which, being linked one with the other by means of the four
elementary modifications, were developed in twelve concentric
spheres.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
The ineffable Being which filled these
twelve spheres without being understood by any one, was
God. Pythagoras gave to It, truth for soul and light for
body.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span>
The Intelligence which peopled the three worlds
were, firstly, the immortal gods properly so-called; secondly,
the glorified heroes; thirdly, the terrestial demons. The
immortal gods, direct emanations of the uncreated Being
and manifestation of Its infinite faculties, were thus named
because they could not depart from the divine life&mdash;&#8203;that is,
they could never fall away from their Father into oblivion,
wandering in the darkness of ignorance and of impiety;
whereas the souls of men, which produced, according to
their degree of purity, glorified heroes and terrestrial demons,
were able to depart sometimes from the divine life
by voluntary drawing away from God; because the death
of the intellectual essence, according to Pythagoras and
imitated in this by Plato, was only ignorance and
impiety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span>
It must be observed that in my translation I have not
rendered the Greek word δαίμονες by the word <i>demons</i>,
but by that of <i>spirits</i>, on account of the evil meaning that
Christianity has attached to it, as I explained in a preceding
note.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>This application of the number 12 to the Universe is
not at all an arbitrary invention of Pythagoras; it was
common to the Chaldeans, to the Egyptians from whom he
had received it, and to the principal peoples of the
earth<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>:
it gave rise to the institution of the zodiac, whose division
into twelve asterisms has been found everywhere existent
from time immemorial.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span>
The distinction of the three
worlds and their development into a number, more or less
great, of concentric spheres inhabited by intelligences of
different degrees of purity, were also known before Pythagoras,
who in this only spread the doctrine which he had
received at Tyre, at Memphis, and at
Babylon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
This
doctrine was that of the Indians. One finds still today
among the Burmans, the division of all the created beings
established in three classes, each of which contains a certain
number of species, from the material beings to the spiritual,
from the sentient to the
intelligible.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
The Brahmans,
who count fifteen spheres in the universe,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
appear to
unite the three primordial worlds with the twelve concentric
spheres which result from their development. Zoroaster,
who admitted the dogma of the three worlds, limited the
inferior world to the vortex of the moon. There, according
to him, the empire of evil and of matter comes to an
end.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span>
This idea thus conceived has been general; it was that of
all the ancient philosophers<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>;
and what is very remarkable,
is that it has been adopted by the Christian theosophists
who certainly were not sufficiently learned to act through
imitation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span>
The followers of Basil, those of Valentine,
and all the gnostics have imbibed from this source the
system of emanations which has enjoyed such a great renown
in the school of Alexandria. According to this system,
the Absolute Unity, or God, was conceived as the spiritual
Soul of the Universe, the Principle of existence, the Light
of lights; it was believed that this creative Unity, inaccessible
to the understanding even, produced by emanation
a diffusion of light which, proceeding from the centre to
the circumference, losing insensibly its splendour and its
purity in proportion as it receded from its source, ended by
being absorbed in the confines of darkness; so that its divergent
rays, becoming less and less spiritual and, moreover,
repulsed by the darkness, were condensed in commingling
with it, and, taking a material shape, formed all the kinds of
beings that the world contains. Thus was admitted, between
the Supreme Being and man, an incalculable chain
of intermediary beings whose perfections decreased proportionably
with their alienation from the Creative Principle.
All the philosophers and all the sectarians who admired
this spiritual hierarchy considered, under the relations
peculiar to them, the different beings of which it was composed.
The Persian magians who saw there genii, more or
less perfect, gave them names relative to their perfections,
and later made use of these same names to evoke them:
from this came the Persian magic, which the Jews, having
received by tradition during their captivity in Babylon,
called <i>Kabbala</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
This magic became mixed with astrology
among the Chaldeans, who regarded the stars as animated
beings belonging to the universal chain of divine
emanations; in Egypt, it became linked with the mysteries
of Nature, and was enclosed in the sanctuaries, where it
was taught by the priests under the safeguard of symbols
and hieroglyphics. Pythagoras, in conceiving this spiritual
hierarchy as a geometrical progression, considered the beings
which compose it under harmonious relations, and based,
by analogy, the laws of the universe upon those of music.
He called the movement of the celestial spheres, harmony,
and made use of numbers to express the faculties of different
beings, their relations and their influences. Hierocles mentions
a sacred book attributed to this philosopher, in which
he called the divinity, the Number of
numbers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span>
Plato,
who, some centuries later, regarded these same beings as
ideas and types, sought to penetrate their nature and to
subjugate them by dialectics and the force of thought.
Synesius, who united the doctrine of Pythagoras to that of
Plato, sometimes called God, the Number of numbers, and
sometimes the Idea of ideas.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
The gnostics gave to the
intermediary beings the name of
Eons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
This name,
which signifies, in Egyptian, a principle of the will, being
developed by an inherent, plastic faculty, is applied in
Greek to a term of infinite
duration.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></span>
One finds in Hermes
Trismegistus the origin of this change of meaning.
This ancient sage remarks that the two faculties, the two
virtues of God, are the understanding and the soul, and that
the two virtues of the Eon are perpetuity and immortality.
The essence of God, he said again, is the good and the beautiful,
beatitude and wisdom; the essence of Eon, is being
always the same.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></span>
But, not content with assimilating
beings of the celestial hierarchy to ideas, to numbers, or to
the plastic principle of the will, there were philosophers
who preferred to designate them by the name of Words.
Plutarch said on one occasion that words, ideas, and divine
emanations reside in heaven and in the
stars.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></span>
Philo
gives in more than one instance the name of word to angels;
and Clement of Alexandria relates that the Valentinians
often called their Eons thus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
According to Beausobre,
the philosophers and theologians, seeking for terms in which
to express incorporal substances, designated them by some
one of their attributes or by some one of their operations,
naming them <i>Spirits</i>, on account of the subtlety of their
substance; <i>Intelligences</i>, on account of the thought; <i>Words</i>,
on account of the reason; <i>Angels</i>, on account of their services;
<i>Eons</i>, on account of their manner of subsisting, always
equal, without change and without
alteration.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
Pythagoras
called them Gods, Heroes, Demons,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></span>
relative to their
respective elevation and the harmonious position of the
three worlds which they inhabit. This cosmogonic ternary
joined with Creative Unity, constitutes the famous Quaternary,
or Sacred Tetrad, the subject of which will be taken
up further on.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Purification</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">4. <i>Be a good son, just brother, spouse tender, and good father.</i></p>

<p>The aim of the doctrine of Pythagoras was to enlighten
men, to purify them of their vices, to deliver them from
their errors, and to restore them to virtue and to truth; and
after having caused them to pass through all the degrees
of the understanding and intelligence, to render them like
unto the immortal gods.</p>

<p>This philosopher had for this purpose divided his doctrine
into two parts: the purgative part and the unitive
part. Through the first, man became purified of his uncleanness,
emerged from the darkness of ignorance, and
attained to virtue: through the second, he used his acquired
virtue to become united to the Divinity through whose
means he arrived at perfection. These two parts are found
quite distinct in the Golden Verses. Hierocles, who has
clearly grasped them, speaks of it in the beginning of his
<i>Commentaries</i> and designates them by two words which
contain, he said, all the doctrine of Pythagoras, <i>Purification</i>
and <i>Perfection</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></span>
The Magians and the Chaldeans, all
of whose principles Pythagoras had adopted, were agreed
on this point, and in order to express their idea, made use
of a parabolical phrase very celebrated among them. “We
consume,” they said, “the refuse of matter by the fire of
divine love.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span>
An anonymous author who has written an
history of Pythagoras, preserved by Photius, said that the
disciples of this great man taught that one perfects oneself
in three ways: in communing with the gods, in doing good
in imitation of the gods, and in departing from this life to
rejoin the gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
The first of these ways is contained in
the first three lines of the Golden Verses which concern the
cult rendered, according to the law and according to the
faith, to the Gods, to the glorified Heroes, and to the Spirits.
The second, that is, the Purification, begins at the fourth
line which makes the subject of this Examination. The
third, that is, the union with the Divinity, or Perfection,
begins at the fortieth line of my translation:</p>

<p class="center small">Let not sleep e’er close thy tired eyes.</p>

<p>Thus the division that I have believed ought to be made
of this short poem is not at all arbitrary, as one sees the
judicious Bayle had remarked it before
me.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of observation, that Pythagoras begins the
purgative part of his doctrine by commending the observance
of natural duties, and that he places in the rank of
primary virtues, filial piety, paternal and conjugal love.
Thus this admirable philosopher made it his first care to
strengthen the ties of blood and make them cherished and
sacred; he exhorts respect to children, tenderness to parents,
and union to all the members of the family; he follows thus
the profound sentiment which Nature inspires in all sentient
beings, very different in this from certain legislators,
blinded by false politics, who, in order to conduct men to
I know not what power and what imaginary welfare, have
wished, on the contrary, to break those ties, annihilate those
relationships of father, son, and brother, to concentrate,
they said, upon a being of reason called Country the affection
that the soul divides among those objects of its
first love.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></span>
If the legislators had cared to reflect a
moment, they would have seen that there existed no country
for the one who had no father, and that the respect and love
that a man in his virile age feels for the place of his birth,
holds its principle and receives its force from those same
sentiments that he felt in his infancy for his mother. Every
effect proclaims a cause; every edifice rests upon a foundation:
the real cause of love of country is maternal love; the
sole foundations of the social edifice are paternal power and
filial respect. From this sole power issues that of the prince,
who, in every well-organized state, being considered as
father of the people, has right to the obedience and respect
of his children.</p>

<p>I am going to make here a singular comparison which I
beg the reader to observe. Moses, instructed in the same
school as Pythagoras, after having announced the Unity of
God in the famous Decalogue which contains the summary
of his law, and having commanded its adoration to his
people, announces for the first virtue, filial
piety<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></span>; “Honour,”
he said, “thy father and thy mother, that thy days
may be multiplied in this country of Adam, that Jhôah,
thy Gods, has given thee.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The theocratic legislator of the Hebrews in making this
commandment places recompense by the side of precept:
he declares formally that the exercise of filial piety draws
with it a long existence. Now, it must be remarked that
Moses being content with enclosing in his doctrine the sole
purgative part, doubtless judging his people not in a condition
to support the unitive part, spoke to them nowhere
of the immortality which is its consequence; contenting
himself with promising the joys of temporal blessings,
among which he carefully placed in the first rank a long
life. Experience has proved, relative to people in general,
that Moses spoke with a profound understanding of the
causes which prolong the duration of empires. Filial piety
is the national virtue of the Chinese, the sacred foundation
upon which reposes the social edifice of the greatest and the
most ancient people of the
world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></span>
This virtue has been
to China, for more than four thousand years, what love of
country was to Sparta or to Rome. Sparta and Rome have
fallen notwithstanding the sort of fanaticism with which
their children were animated, and the Chinese Empire
which existed two thousand years before their foundation,
still exists two thousand years after their downfall. If
China has been able to preserve herself in the midst of the
flux and reflux of a thousand revolutions, to save herself
from her own wrecks, to triumph over her own defects, and
to subjugate even her conquerors, she owes it to this virtue
which, raising itself from the humblest citizen to the Son
of heaven seated upon the imperial throne, animates all
the hearts with a sacred fire, of which Nature herself provides
the nourishment and eternalizes the duration. The
Emperor is the father of the state; two hundred million
men, who regard themselves as his children, compose his
immense family; what human effort could overthrow this
colossus?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">5. <i>Choose for thy friend, the friend of virtue;<br />
     Yield to his gentle counsels, profit by his life,<br />
     And for a trifling grievance never leave him</i>;</p>

<p>After the duties which have their source directly in Nature,
Pythagoras commends to his disciples those which
proceed from the social state; friendship follows immediately
filial piety, paternal and fraternal love; but this philosopher
makes a distinction full of meaning: he ordains to honour
one’s relations; he says to choose one’s friends. This is why:
it is Nature that presides at our birth, that gives us a father,
a mother, brothers, sisters, relations of kinship, a position
upon the earth, and a place in society; all this depends not
upon us: all this, according to the vulgar, is the work of
hazard; but according to the Pythagorean philosopher these
are the consequences of an anterior order, severe and irresistible,
called Fortune or Necessity. Pythagoras opposed
to this restrained nature, a free Nature, which, acting upon
forced things as upon brute matter, modifies them and
draws as it wills, good or bad results. This second nature
was called Power or Will: it is this which rules the life of
man, and which directs his conduct according to the elements
furnished him by the first. Necessity and Power
are, according to Pythagoras, the two opposed motives of
the sublunary world where man is relegated. These two
motives draw their force from a superior cause that the
ancients named <dfn>Nemesis</dfn>, the fundamental
decree,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span>
that
we name <dfn>Providence</dfn>. Thus then, Pythagoras recognized,
relative to man, things constrained and things free, according
as they depend upon Necessity or the Will: he ranked filial
piety in the first and friendship in the second. Man not
being free to give himself parents of his choice, must honour
them such as they are, and fulfil in regard to them all the
duties of nature, whatever wrong they might do towards
him; but as nothing constrains him from giving his friendship,
he need give it only to the one who shows himself
worthy of it by his attachment to virtue.</p>

<p>Let us observe an important point. In China where
filial piety is regarded as the root of all virtues and the first
source of instruction,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></span>
the exercise of the duties which
it imposes admits of no exception. As the legislator teaches
there that the greatest crime is to lack in filial piety, he
infers that he who has been a good son will be a good father
and that thus nothing will break the social
tie<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></span>;
for he
first establishes this virtue which embraces all, from the
emperor to the lowliest of his subjects, and that it is for the
peoples what the regularity of the celestial movements is
for the ethereal space: but in Italy and in Greece where
Pythagoras established his dogmas, it would have been
dangerous for him to give the same extension, since this
virtue not being that of the State, would necessarily involve
abuses in the paternal authority, already excessive among
certain peoples. That is the reason the disciples of this
philosopher, in distinguishing between forced and voluntary
actions, judged wisely that it would be necessary to apply
here the distinction: therefore they urged to honour one’s
father and mother and to obey them in all that concerns
the body and mundane things, but without abandoning
one’s soul to them<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></span>;
for the divine law declares free what
has not been received from them and delivers it from
their power. Pythagoras furthermore had favoured this
opinion by saying, that after having chosen a friend from
among the men most commended for their virtues, it was
necessary to learn by his actions and to be guided by his
discourse: which testified to the lofty idea that he had of
friendship. “Friends,” he said, “are like companions of
travel who reciprocally assist each other to persevere in
the path of the noblest
life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></span>
” It is to him that we owe
that beautiful expression, so often quoted, so little felt by
the generality of men, and which a victorious king, Alexander
the Great, felt so keenly and expressed so felicitously
by the following: “My friend is another
myself.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></span>
It is
also from him that Aristotle had borrowed that beautiful
definition: “The real friend is one soul that lives in two
bodies.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span>
The founder of the Lyceum, in giving such a
definition of friendship, spoke rather by theory than by
practice, he who reasoning one day upon friendship, cried
ingenuously: “Oh, my friends! there are no
friends.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Pythagoras did not conceive friendship as a simple
individual affection, but as an universal benevolence which
should be extended to all men in general, and to all good
people.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></span>
At that time he gave to this virtue the name of
philanthropy. It is the virtue which, under the name of
charity, serves as foundation for the Christian religion.
Jesus offers it to his disciples immediately after divine love,
and as equal to piety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></span>
Zoroaster places it after
sincerity<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></span>;
he wished that man might be pure in thought,
speech, and action; that he might speak the truth, and that
he might do good to all men. Kong-Tse as well as Pythagoras
commended it after filial
piety.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></span>
“All morals,” he
said, “can be reduced to the observation of three fundamental
laws, of the relations between sovereigns and
subjects, between parents and children, between husbands
and wives; and to the strict practice of the five capital
virtues, of which the first is humanity, that is to say, that
universal charity, that expansion of the soul which binds
man to man without distinction.”</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">6. <i>If thou canst at least: for a most rigid law<br />
    Binds Power to Necessity.</i></p>

<p>Here is the proof of what I said just now, that Pythagoras
recognized two motives of human actions, the first, issuing
from a constrained nature, called Necessity; the second
emanating from a free nature, called Power, and both dependent
upon an implied primordial law. This doctrine
was that of the ancient Egyptians, among whom Pythagoras
had imbibed it. “Man is mortal with reference to the body,”
they said, “but he is immortal with reference to the soul
which constitutes essential man. As immortal he has
authority over all things; but relative to the material and
mortal part of himself, he is subject to
destiny.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>One can see by these few words that the ancient sages
did not give to Destiny the universal influence that certain
philosophers and particularly the Stoics gave to it later on;
but they considered it only as exercising its empire over
matter. It is necessary to believe that since the followers
of the Porch had defined it as a chain of causes, by virtue
of which the past has taken place, the present exists, and
the future is to be realized<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></span>;
or still better, as the rule of
the law by which the Universe is
governed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></span>;
one must
believe, I say, that these philosophers confounded Destiny
with Providence, and did not distinguish the effect from
its cause, since these definitions conform only with the
fundamental law of which destiny is but an emanation.
This confusion of words had to produce and in fact did
produce, among the Stoics, an inversion of ideas which was
the most unfortunate result<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></span>;
for, as they established,
according to their system, a chain of good and evil that
nothing could either alter or break, one easily inferred that
the Universe being subject to the attraction of a blind fatality,
all actions are here necessarily determined in advance,
forced, and thereafter indifferent in themselves; so that
good and evil, virtue and vice, are vain words, things whose
existence is purely ideal and relative.</p>

<p>The Stoics would have evaded these calamitous results
if, like Pythagoras, they had admitted the two motives
of which I have spoken, Necessity and Power; and if, far
from instituting Necessity alone as absolute master of the
Universe, under the name of Destiny or Fatality, they had
seen it balanced by the Power of the Will, and subject to the
Providential Cause whence all emanates. The disciples
of Plato would also have evaded many errors, if they had
clearly understood this concatenation of the two opposed
principles, from which results universal equilibrium; but
following certain false interpretations of the doctrine of
their master regarding the soul of matter, they had imagined
that this soul was no other than Necessity by which it is
ruled<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></span>;
so that, according to them, this soul being inherent
in matter, and bad in itself, gave to Evil a necessary
existence: a dogma quite formidable, since it makes the
world to be considered as the theatre of a struggle without
beginning or end, between Providence, principle of Good, and
the soul of matter, principle of Evil. The greatest mistake
of the Platonists, exactly contrary to that of the Stoics,
was in having confused the free power of the Will with the
divine Providence, in having instituted it for the principle
of good and thus being put in position of maintaining that
there are two souls in the world, a beneficent one, God, and
a malefic one, Matter. This system, approved of by many
celebrated men of antiquity and which Beausobre assures
was the most widely received,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></span>
offers, as I have observed,
the very great disadvantage of giving to Evil a necessary
existence, that is to say, an independent and eternal existence.
Now, Bayle has very well proved, by attacking this
system through that of Manes, that two opposed Principles
cannot exist equally eternal and independent of one another,
because the clearest ideas of order teach us that a Being
which exists by itself, which is necessary, which is eternal,
must be unique, infinite, all-powerful, and endowed with all
manner of perfections.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not at all certain that Plato may have had the
idea that his disciples have attributed to him, since far
from considering matter as an independent and necessary
being, animated by a soul essentially bad, he seems even to
doubt its existence, going so far as to regard it as pure
nothingness, and calls the bodies which are formed of it,
equivocal beings holding the medium between what is always
existing and what does not exist at
all<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></span>;
he affirms
sometimes that matter has been created and sometimes
that it has not been<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></span>;
and thus falls into contradictions
of which his enemies have taken advantage. Plutarch,
who has clearly seen it, excuses them by saying that this
great philosopher has fallen into these contradictions designedly,
in order to conceal some mystery; a mind constructed
like his not being made to affirm two opposites
in the same sense.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></span>
The mystery that Plato wished to
conceal, as he makes it sufficiently
understood,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></span>
was the
origin of Evil. He himself declares that he has never
revealed and that he never will reveal, in writing, his real
sentiments in this respect. Thus what Chalcidius and after
him André Dacier have given concerning the doctrine of
Plato are only conjectures or very remote inferences drawn
from certain of his dogmas. One has often made use of
this means, with regard to celebrated men whose writings
one comments upon and particularly when one has certain
reasons for presenting one’s ideas <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(sous un côté)</i> which outlines
or which favours an opinion either favourable or unfavourable.
It is this which happened more to Manes than to
any other; his doctrine concerning the two Principles has
been greatly calumniated, and without knowing just what
he meant by them, one hastened to condemn him without
investigating what he had said; adopting as axioms that
he had laid down, inferences the most bizarre and most
ridiculous that his enemies had drawn from certain equivocal
phrases.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span>
What persuades me to make this observation,
is because it has been proved that Manes had indeed admitted
two opposed Principles of Good and Evil, eternal
independents, and holding of themselves their proper and
absolute existence, since it is easy to see that Zoroaster,
whose doctrine he had principally imitated, had not admitted
them as such, but as equally issued from a superior Cause,
concerning the essence of which he was
silent.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></span>
I am
very much inclined to believe that the Christian doctors
who have transmitted to us the ideas of this mighty heresiarch,
blinded by their hatred or by their ignorance, have
travestied them as I find that the Platonist philosophers,
bewildered by their own opinions, have entirely disfigured
those of the illustrious founder of the Academy. The errors
of both have been, taking for absolute beings, what Zoroaster
and Pythagoras, Plato or Manes, had put down as emanations,
results, forces, or even the simple abstractions of the
understanding. Thus Ormuzd and Ahriman, Power and
Necessity, the Same and the Other, Light and Darkness,
are, in reality, only the same things diversely expressed,
diversely sensed, but always drawn from the same origin
and subject to the same fundamental Cause of the Universe.</p>

<p>It is not true therefore, as Chalcidius has stated, that
Pythagoras may have demonstrated that evil exists
necessarily,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_310" id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></span>
because matter is evil in itself. Pythagoras
never said that matter might be an absolute being whose
essence might be composed of evil. Hierocles, who had
studied the doctrine of this great man and that of Plato,
has denied that either the one or the other had ever declared
matter as a being existing by itself. He has proved, on the
contrary, that Plato taught, following the steps of Pythagoras,
that the World was produced from Nothing, and that
his followers were mistaken when they thought that he
admitted an uncreated
matter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></span>
Power and Necessity
(mentioned in the lines at the head of this Examination)
are not, as has been believed, the absolute source of good
and evil. Necessity is not more evil in itself than Power
is not good; it is from the usage that man is called to make
of them, and from their employment which is indicated by
wisdom or ignorance, virtue or vice, that results Good or
Evil. This has been felt by Homer who has expressed it
in an admirable allegory, by representing the god of gods
himself, Jupiter, opening indifferently the sources of good
and evil upon the universe.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Beside Jove’s threshold stand two casks of gifts for man.</div>
<div class="i0">One cask contains the evil, one the
      good,...<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></span></div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Those who have rejected this thought of Homer have
not reflected enough upon the prerogatives of poetry, which
are to particularize what is universal and to represent as
done what is to be done. Good and Evil do not emanate
from Jupiter in action, but in potentiality, that is to say,
that the same thing represented by Jupiter or the Universal
Principle of the Will and the Intelligence, becomes good
or evil, according as it is determined by the particular operation
of each individual principle of the Will and the
Intelligence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_313" id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>
Now, man is to the Being called Jupiter by
Homer, as the particular is to the
Universal.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">7. <i>Still it is given thee to fight and overcome<br />
    Thy foolish passions: learn thou to subdue them.</i></p>

<p>It seems that Lysis, foreseeing the wrong inductions
that would be drawn from what he had said, and as if he
had a presentiment that one would not fail to generalize the
influence of Necessity upon the actions of men, may have
wished beforehand to oppose himself to the destructive
dogma of fatality, by establishing the empire of the Will
over the passions. This is in the doctrine of Pythagoras
the real foundation of the liberty of man: for, according to
this philosopher, no one is free, only he who knows how to
master himself,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></span>
and the yoke of the passions is much
heavier and more difficult to throw off than that of the most
cruel tyrants. Pythagoras, however, did not, according
to Hierocles, prescribe destroying the passions, as the Stoics
taught in late times; but only to watch over them and repress
excess in them, because all excess is
vicious.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></span>
He regarded
the passions as useful to man, and although produced
in principle by Necessity, and given by an irresistible destiny,
as nevertheless submissive in their use to the free power
of the Will. Plato had well realized this truth and had
forcibly indicated it in many passages of his works: one
finds it chiefly in the second dialogue of Hippias, where
this philosopher shows, evidently without seeming to have
the design, that man good or bad, virtuous or criminal,
truthful or false, is only such by the power of his will, and
that the passion which carries him to virtue or to vice, to
truth or falsehood, is nothing in itself; so that no man is
bad, only by the faculty which he has of being good; nor
good, only by the faculty which he has of being bad.</p>

<p>But has man the faculty of being good or bad at his pleasure,
and is he not irresistibly drawn toward vice or virtue?
This is a question which has tried all the great thinkers of
the earth, and which according to circumstances has caused
storms of more or less violence. It is necessary, however,
to give close attention to one thing, which is, that before the
establishment of Christianity and the admission of original
sin as fundamental dogma of religion, no founder of sect,
no celebrated philosopher had positively denied the free
will, nor had taught ostensibly that man may be necessarily
determined to Evil or to Good and predestined from all
time to vice or virtue, to wickedness or eternal happiness.
It is indeed true that this cruel fatality seemed often to
follow from their principles as an inevitable consequence,
and that their adversaries reproached them with it; but
nearly all rejected it as an insult, or a false interpretation
of their system. The first who gave place to this accusation,
in ancient times, was a certain Moschus, a Phœnician
philosopher, who, according to Strabo, lived before the epoch
in which the war of Troy is said to have taken place, that
is to say, about twelve or thirteen centuries before our
era.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></span>
This philosopher detaching himself from the theosophical
doctrine, the only one known at that time, and having
sought the reason of things in the things themselves, can
be considered as the real founder of Natural Philosophy:
he was the first who made abstraction from the Divinity,
and from the intelligence, and assumed that the Universe
existing by itself was composed of indivisible particles,
which, endowed with figures and diverse movements, produced
by their fortuitous combinations an infinite series
of beings, generating, destroying, and renewing themselves
unceasingly. These particles, which the Greeks named
<i>atoms</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></span>
on account of their indivisibility, constituted the
particular system which still bears this name. Leucippus,
Democritus, and Epicurus adopted it, adding to it their own
ideas; and Lucretius having naturalized it among the Romans,
favoured its passage down to these modern times,
when the greater part of our philosophers have done nothing
but renovate it under other
forms.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_319" id="fnanchor_319"></a><a href="#footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></span>
Assuredly there is
no system whence the fatal necessity of all things issues more
inevitably than from that of atoms; also it is certain that
Democritus was accused of admitting a compulsory
destiny,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_320" id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span>
although, like Leibnitz, he admitted to each atom an animated
and sentient nature.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_321" id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></span>
It is not known if he replied
to this accusation; but there are certain proofs that Epicurus,
who had less right than he to reject it, since he regarded
atoms as absolutely
inanimate,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_322" id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></span>
rejected it nevertheless,
and not wishing to admit a dogma subversive of all morals,
he declared himself against it, and taught the liberty of
man.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>A singular thing is, that this fatality which appears attached
to the system of atoms, whence the materialist promoters,
true to their principle, banished the influence of
Divine Providence,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_324" id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></span>
followed still more naturally from
the opposed system, wherein the spiritualist philosophers
admitted this Providence to the full extent of its power.
According to this last system, a sole and same spiritual
substance filled the Universe, and by its diverse modifications
produced there all the phenomena by which the senses
are affected. Parmenides, Melissus, and Zeno of Elea, who
adopted it, sustained it with great success: they asserted
that matter was only pure illusion, that there is nothing in
things, that bodies and all their variations are only pure
appearances, and that therefore nothing really exists outside
of spirit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span>
Zeno of Elea particularly, who denied the
existence of movement, brought against this existence some
objections very difficult to
remove.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></span>
The Stoic philosophers
became more or less strongly attached to this opinion.
Chrysippus, one of the firmest pillars of the Porch,
taught that God is the soul of the world, and the world,
the universal extension of that soul. He said that by
Jupiter, should be understood, the eternal law, the fatal
necessity, the immutable truth of all future
things.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></span>
Now, it is evident that if, in accordance with the energetic
expression of Seneca, this unique principle of the Universe
has ordained once to obey always its own
command,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></span>
the Stoics were not able to escape from the reproach that
was directed toward them, of admitting the most absolute
fatality, since the soul of man being, according to them, only
a portion of the Divinity, its actions could have no other
cause than God Himself who had willed
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></span>
Nevertheless
Chrysippus rejected the reproach in the same manner
as did Epicurus; he always sustained the liberty of man,
notwithstanding the irresistible force that he admitted in
the unique Cause<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></span>;
and what seemed a manifest contradiction,
he taught that the soul sins only by the impulse of
its own will, and therefore that the blame of its errors should
not be put upon destiny.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>But it suffices to reflect a moment upon the nature of
the principles set down by Epicurus, by Chrysippus, and
by all those who have preceded them or followed them in
their divergent opinions, to see that the inferences drawn
by their adversaries were just, and that they could not
refute them without contradicting
themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></span>
Every
time that one has claimed to found the Universe upon the
existence of a sole material or spiritual nature, and to make
proceed from this sole nature the explanation of all phenomena,
one has become exposed and always will be, to insurmountable
difficulties. It is always in asking what the
origin of Good and Evil is, that all the systems of this sort
have been irresistibly overthrown, from Moschus, Leucippus,
and Epicurus, down to Spinoza and Leibnitz; from
Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, and Chrysippus, down to Berkeley
and Kant. For, let there be no misunderstanding, the
solution of the problem concerning free will depends upon
preliminary knowledge of the origin of evil, so that one
cannot reply plainly to this question: Whence comes Evil?
Neither can one reply to this one: Is man free? And that
one be not still further deceived here, the knowledge of the
origin of evil, if it has been acquired, has never been openly
divulged: it has been profoundly buried with that of the
Unity of God in the ancient mysteries and has never
emerged except enveloped in a triple veil. The initiates imposed
upon themselves a rigid silence concerning what they
called the <i>sufferings of God</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></span>:
his death, his descent into
the infernal regions, and his
resurrection.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></span>
They knew
that the serpent was, in general, the symbol of evil, and that
it was under this form that the Python had fought with
and been slain by Apollo.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></span>
The theosophists have not
made a public dogma of the Unity of God, precisely on
account of the explanation that it would be necessary to
give to the origin of good and evil; for without this explanation,
the dogma in itself would have been incomprehensible.
Moses realized it perfectly, and in the plan which he had
conceived of striking the people whose legislator he was,
with a character as extraordinary as indelible, by founding
his cult upon the publicity of a dogma hidden, until that
time in the depths of the sanctuaries and reserved for the
initiates alone, he did not hesitate to divulge what he knew
pertaining to the creation of the world and the origin of evil.
It is true that the manner in which he gave it, under a simplicity
and apparent clarity, concealed a profundity and
obscurity almost unfathomable; but the form which he gave
to this formidable mystery sufficed to support, in the opinion
of the vulgar, the Unity of God and this was all that he
wished to do.</p>

<p>Now it is the essence of theosophy to be dogmatic, and
that of natural philosophy to be skeptical; the theosophist
speaks by faith, the physicist speaks by reason; the doctrine
of the one excludes the discussion that the system of the
other admits and even necessitates. Up to that time, theosophy
dominating upon the earth had taught the influence
of the will, and the tradition which was preserved in it
among all the nations of the earth during an incalculable
succession of centuries gave it the force of demonstration.
Among the Indians, Krishna; among the Persians, Zoroaster;
in China, Kong-Tse; in Egypt, Thoth; among the Greeks,
Orpheus; even Odin, among the Scandinavians; everywhere
the lawgivers of the people had linked the liberty of man with
the consoling dogma of Divine
rovidence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></span>
The peoples
accustomed to worship in polytheism the Divine Infinity
and not its Unity, did not find it strange to be guided,
protected, and watched over on the one side, whereas they
remained, on the other, free in their movements; and they
did not trouble themselves to find the source of good and
evil since they saw it in the objects of their cult, in these
same gods, the greater part of whom being neither essentially
good nor essentially bad were reputed to inspire in
them the virtues or the vices which, gathered freely by them,
rendered them worthy of recompense or
chastisement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></span>
But when Natural Philosophy appeared, the face of things
was changed. The natural philosophers, substituting the observation
of nature and experience for mental contemplation
and the inspiration of theosophists, thought that they
could make sentient what was intelligible, and promised to
prove by fact and reasoning whatever up to that time had
had only proofs of sentiment and analogy. They brought
to light the great mystery of Universal Unity, and transforming
this Intellectual Unity into corporal substance
placed it in water,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></span>
in infinite space,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></span>
in the air,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span>
in the
fire,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span>
whence they draw in turn the essential and formal
existence of all things. The one, attached to the school of
Ionia, established as fundamental maxim, that there is but
one principle of all; and the other, attached to that of Elea,
started from this axiom that nothing is made from
nothing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span>
The former sought the <em>how</em>, and the latter the <em>why</em> of things;
and all were united in saying that there is no effect without
cause. Their different systems, based upon the principles
of reasoning which seemed incontestable, and supported by
a series of imposing conclusions, had, at first, a prodigious
success; but this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(éclat)</i> paled considerably when soon the disciples
of Pythagoras, and a little later those of Socrates and
Plato, having received from their masters the theosophical
tradition, stopped these sophistical physicists in the midst
of their triumphs, and, asking them the cause of physical
and of moral evil, proved to them that they knew nothing
of it; and that, in whatever fashion they might deduce it by
their system, they could not avoid establishing an absolute
fatality, destructive to the liberty of man, which by depriving
it of morality of actions, by confounding vice and virtue,
ignorance and wisdom, made of the Universe no more than
a frightful chaos. In vain these had thrust back the reproach
and claimed that the inference was false; their adversaries
pursuing them on their own ground cried out to
them: If the principle that you admit is good, whence comes
it that men are wicked and
miserable?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
If this unique
principle is bad, whence emerge goodness and
virtue?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span>
If nature is the expression of this sole principle, how is it
not constant and why does its government sow goodness
and evil?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span>
The materialists had recourse vainly to a
certain deviation in atoms,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></span>
and the spiritualists, to a
certain adjuvant cause quite similar to efficacious
grace<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span>;
the theosophists would never have renounced them if they
had not enclosed them in a syllogistic circle, by making
them admit, sometimes that the unique and all-powerful
Principle cannot think of
everything,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>

virtue<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span>;
paradoxes of which they had no trouble demonstrating the

<p>Take a survey of all the nations of the world, peruse all
the books that you please, and you will find the liberty of
man, the free will of his actions, the influence of his will over
his passions, only in the theosophical tradition. Wherever
you see physical or metaphysical systems, doctrines of
whatever kind they may be, founded upon a sole principle
of the material or spiritual Universe, you can conclude
boldly that absolute fatality results from it and that their
authors find themselves in need of making two things one: or
of explaining the origin of good and evil, which is impossible;
or of establishing the free will <i>a priori</i>, which is a manifest
contradiction of their reasonings. If you care to penetrate
into metaphysical depths, examine this decisive point upon
this matter. Moses founded his cult upon the Unity of God
and he explained the origin of evil; but he found himself
forced by the very nature of this formidable mystery to
envelop his explanation with such a veil, that it remained
impenetrable for all those who had not received the traditional
revelation; so that the liberty of man existed in his
cult only by favour of theosophical tradition, and that it
became weaker and disappeared entirely from it with this
same tradition, the two opposed sects of the Pharisees and
Sadducees which divided the cult prove
this.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></span>
The
former, attached to the tradition and allegorizing the text
of the <i>Sepher</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></span>
admitted the free will<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></span>;
the others, on
the contrary, rejecting it and following the literal meaning,
established an irresistible destiny to which all was subjected.
The most orthodox Hebrews, and those even who
passed as seers or prophets of the nation, had no difficulty
in attributing to God the cause of
Evil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span>
They were obviously
authorized by the history of the downfall of the
first man, and by the dogma of original sin, which they took
according to the meaning attached to it by the vulgar. It
also happened, after the establishment of Christianity and
of Islamism, that this dogma, received by both cults in all
its extent and in all its literal obscurity, has necessarily
drawn with it predestination, which is, in other words, only
the fatality of the ancients. Mohammed, more enthusiast
than learned, and stronger in imagination than in reasoning,
has not hesitated a moment, admitting it as an inevitable
result of the Unity of God, which he announced after
Moses.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></span>
It is true that a few Christian doctors, when they have
been capable of perceiving the inferences in it have denied
this predestination, and have wished, either by allegorizing
the dogma of original sin, as Origen, or rejecting it wholly,
as Pelagius, to establish the free will and the power of the
will; but it is easy to see, in reading the history of the church,
that the most rigid Christians, such as Saint Augustine
and the ecclesiastical authority itself, have always upheld
predestination as proceeding necessarily from the divine
Prescience and from the All-Powerful, without which there
is no Unity. The length of this examination forces me to
suspend the proofs that I was going to give regarding this
last assertion; but further on I will return to it.</p>

<p>Pythagoras considered man under three principal modifications,
like the Universe; and this is why he gave to man
the name of the microcosm or the small
world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></span>
Nothing
was more common among the ancient nations than to compare
the Universe to a grand man, and man, to a small
Universe.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></span>
The Universe, considered as a grand and
animated All, composed of intelligence, soul and body, was
called Pan or Phanes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_358" id="fnanchor_358"></a><a href="#footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></span>
<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_359" id="fnanchor_359"></a><a href="#footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></span>
Man, or microcosm, was composed
in the same way but in an inverse manner, of
body, soul, and intelligence; and each of these three parts
was, in its turn, considered under three modifications, so
that the ternary ruling in the whole ruled equally in the
least of its subdivisions. Each ternary, from that which
embraced Immensity, to that which constituted the weakest
individual was, according to Pythagoras, included in an
absolute or relative Unity, and formed thus, as I have already
said, the Quaternary or Sacred Tetrad of the Pythagoreans.
This Quaternary was universal or particular.
Pythagoras was not, however, the inventor of this doctrine:
it was spread from China to the depths of
Scandinavia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_360" id="fnanchor_360"></a><a href="#footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></span>
One finds it likewise expressed in the oracles of
Zoroaster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_361" id="fnanchor_361"></a><a href="#footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">In the Universe a Ternary shines forth,</div>
<div class="i0">And the Monad is its principle.</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem-container-->

<p>Thus, according to this doctrine, Man, considered as a
relative unity contained in the absolute Unity of the Grand
All, presents himself as the universal ternary, under three
principal modifications, of body, soul, and spirit or intelligence.
The soul, considered as the seat of the passions, is
presented in its turn, under the three faculties of the rational,
irascible or appetent soul. Now, in the opinion of Pythagoras,
the vice of the appetent faculty of the soul is intemperance
or avarice; that of the irascible faculty is
cowardice; and that of the rational faculty is folly. The vice
which reaches these three faculties is injustice. In order
to avoid these vices, the philosopher commends four principal
virtues to his disciples: temperance for the appetent
faculty, courage for the irascible faculty, prudence for the
rational faculty, and for these three faculties together,
justice, which he regards as the most perfect virtue of the
soul.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_362" id="fnanchor_362"></a><a href="#footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></span>
I say the soul, because the body and the intelligence,
being equally developed by means of three faculties
instinctive or spiritual, as well as the soul, were susceptible
of the vices and the virtues which were peculiar to them.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">9. <i>Speak not nor act before thou hast reflected;<br />
          Be just.</i></p>

<p>By the preceding lines, Lysis, speaking in the name
of Pythagoras, had commended temperance and diligence;
he had prescribed particularly watching over the irascible
faculty, and moderating its excesses; by these, he indicates
the peculiar character of prudence which is reflection and
he imposes the obligation of being just, by binding, as it
were, the most energetic idea of justice with that of death,
as may be seen in the subsequent lines:</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">10. … <i>Remember that a power invincible<br />
            Ordains to die</i>; …</p>

<p>That is to say, remember thou that the fatal necessity
to which thou art subjected in reference to the material and
mortal part of thyself, according to the sentence of the
ancient sages,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_363" id="fnanchor_363"></a><a href="#footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></span>
will strike thee particularly in the objects
of thy cupidity, of thy intemperance, in the things which
will have excited thy folly, or flattered thy cowardice;
remember thou that death will break the frail instruments
of thy wrath, will extinguish the firebrands that it will
have lighted; remember thou finally,</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">11. … <i>That riches and the honours<br />
            Easily acquired, are easy thus to lose.</i></p>

<p>Be just: injustice has often easy triumphs; but what
remains after death of the riches that it has procured?
Nothing but the bitter remembrance of their loss, and the
nakedness of a shameful vice uncovered and reduced to
impotency.</p>

<p>I have proceeded rapidly in the explanation of the foregoing
lines, because the morals which they contain, founded
upon the proofs of sentiment, are not susceptible of receiving
others. I do not know if this simple reflection has already
been made, but in any case it ought to draw with it one more
complicated, and serve to find the reason for the surprising
harmony which reigns, and which has always reigned, among
all the peoples of the earth upon the subject of morals.
Man has been allowed to disagree upon subjects of reasoning
and opinion, to differ in a thousand ways in those of
taste, to dispute upon the forms of cult, the dogmas of
teachings, the bases of science, to build an infinity of psychological
and physical systems; but Man has never been able,
without belying his own conscience, to deny the truth and
universality of morals. Temperance, prudence, courage,
and justice, have always been considered as virtues, and
avarice, folly, cowardice, and injustice, as vices; and this,
without the least discussion. Never has any legislator
said that it was necessary to be a bad son, a bad friend, a
bad citizen, envious, ungrateful, perjured. The men most
beset with these vices have always hated them in others,
have concealed them at home, and their very hypocrisy
has been a new homage rendered to morals.</p>

<p>If certain sectarians, blinded by a false zeal and furthermore
systematically ignorant and intolerant, have circulated
that the cults differing from theirs lacked morals, or received
impure ones, it is because they either misunderstood the
true principles of morals, or they calumniated them; principles
are the same everywhere; only their application is
more or less rigid and their consequences are more or less
well applied in accordance with the times, the places, and
the men. The Christians extol, and with reason, the purity
and the sanctity of their morals; but if it must be told them
with frankness they have nothing in their sacred books
that cannot be found as forcibly expressed in the sacred
books of other nations, and often even, in the opinion of
impartial travellers, one has seen it much better practised.
For example, the beautiful maxim touching upon the pardon
of offences<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_364" id="fnanchor_364"></a><a href="#footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></span>
is found complete in the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>. It is
written: “O God! greater than all that which is great! if
a man provoke you by his thoughts, by his speech, or by his
actions, if he humbles himself before you, pardon him; even
so, if a man provoke me by his thoughts by his speech or
by his actions may I pardon
him.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_365" id="fnanchor_365"></a><a href="#footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></span>
One finds in the same
book, the precept on charity, such as is practised among the
Mussulmans, and that of agriculture placed in the rank of
virtues, as among the Chinese. “The King whom you love,
what desire you that he shall do, Ormuzd? Do you desire
that, like unto you, he shall nourish the
poor?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_366" id="fnanchor_366"></a><a href="#footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></span>
“The purest point of the law is to sow the land. He who sows
the grain and does it with purity is as great before me as he
who celebrates ten thousand
adorations.…”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_367" id="fnanchor_367"></a><a href="#footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></span>
“Render the earth fertile, cover it with flowers and with fruits;
multiply the springs in the places where there is no
grass.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_368" id="fnanchor_368"></a><a href="#footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></span>
This same maxim of the pardon of offences and those which
decree to return good for evil, and to do unto others what we
would that they should do unto us, is found in many of the
Oriental writings. One reads in the distichs of Hafiz this
beautiful passage:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Learn of the sea-shell to love thine enemy, and to fill with
pearls the hand thrust out to harm thee. Be not less generous
than the hard rock; make resplendent with precious stones, the
arm which rends thy side. Mark thou yonder tree assailed by
a shower of stones; upon those who throw them it lets fall only
delicious fruits or perfumed flowers. The voice of all nature
calls aloud to us: shall man be the only one refusing to heal the
hand which is wounded in striking him? To bless the one who
offends him?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_369" id="fnanchor_369"></a><a href="#footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The evangelical precept paraphrased by Hafiz is found in
substance in a discourse of Lysias; it is clearly expressed by
Thales and Pittacus; Kong-Tse taught it in the same words
as Jesus; finally one finds in the <cite>Arya</cite>, written more than
three centuries before our era, these lines which seem made
expressly to inculcate the maxim and depict the death of
the righteous man:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The duty of a good man, even at the moment of his destruction,
consists not only in forgiving but even in a desire of benefiting
his destroyer; as the Sandal-tree, in the instant of its
overthrow sheds perfume on the ax which fells; and he would
triumph in repeating the verse of Sadi who represents a return
of good for good as a slight reciprocity, but says to the virtuous
man, “confer benefits on him who has injured
thee.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_370" id="fnanchor_370"></a><a href="#footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Interrogate the peoples from the Boreal pole to the
extremities of Asia, and ask them what they think of virtue:
they will respond to you, as Zeno, that it is all that is good
and beautiful; the Scandinavians, disciples of Odin, will
show you the
<cite>Hâvamâl</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_371" id="fnanchor_371"></a><a href="#footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></span>,
sublime discourse of their ancient
legislator, wherein hospitality, charity, justice, and courage
are expressly commended to them: You will know by
tradition that the Celts had the sacred verses of their
Druids, wherein piety, justice, and valour were celebrated
as national
virtues<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_372" id="fnanchor_372"></a><a href="#footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></span>;

that the Egyptians followed
the same idea regarding morals as the Indians their ancient
preceptors; and these ideas, preserved still in the
<cite>Dharma-Shastra</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_374" id="fnanchor_374"></a><a href="#footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></span>
will strike you in the <cite>Kings</cite> of the Chinese. It
is there, in those sacred books whose origin is lost in the
night of time,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_375" id="fnanchor_375"></a><a href="#footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></span>
that you will find at their source the most
sublime maxims of Fo-Hi, Krishna, Thoth, Zoroaster,
Pythagoras, Socrates, and Jesus. Morals, I repeat, are
everywhere the same; therefore it is not upon its written
principles that one should judge of the perfection of the
cult, as has been done without reflection, but upon their
practical application. This application, whence results
the national spirit, depends upon the purity of the religious
dogmas, upon the sublimity of the mysteries, and upon their
more or less great affinity with the Universal Truth which
is the soul, apparent or hidden, of all religion.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">12. <i>As to the evils which Destiny involves,<br />

            &ensp;As much as thou art able, to modify the traits.<br />

<p>I have said that Pythagoras acknowledged two motives
of human actions, the power of the Will and the necessity
of Destiny, and that he subjected both to one fundamental
law called Providence from which they emanated alike.
The first of these motives was free, and the second constrained:
so that man found himself placed between two
opposed, but not injurious natures, indifferently good or
bad, according as he understood the use of them. The
power of the Will was exercised upon the things to be done,
or upon the future; the necessity of Destiny, upon the things
done, or upon the past: and the one nourished the other
unceasingly, by working upon the materials which they reciprocally
furnished each other; for according to this admirable
philosopher, it is of the past that the future is born, of the
future that the past is formed, and of the union of both that
is engendered the always existing present, from which they
draw alike their origin: a most profound idea that the
Stoics had
adopted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_376" id="fnanchor_376"></a><a href="#footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></span>
Thus, following this doctrine, liberty
rules in the future, necessity in the past, and Providence
over the present. Nothing that exists happens by chance
but by the union of the fundamental and providential law
with the human will which follows or transgresses it, by
operating upon
necessity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_377" id="fnanchor_377"></a><a href="#footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></span>
The harmony of the Will and
Providence constitutes Good; Evil is born of their opposition.
Man has received three forces adapted to each of the
three modifications of his being, to be guided in the course
that he should pursue on earth and all three enchained to
his Will. The first, attached to the body, is instinct; the
second, devoted to the soul, is virtue; the third, appertaining
to intelligence, is science or wisdom. These three forces,
indifferent in themselves, take this name only through the
good usage that the Will makes of it; for, through bad usage
they degenerate into brutishness, vice, and ignorance. Instinct
perceives the physical good or evil resulting from
sensation; virtue recognizes the moral good or evil existing
in sentiment; science judges the intelligible good or evil
which springs from assent. In sensation, good or evil is
called pleasure or pain; in sentiment, love or hate; in assent,
truth or error. Sensation, sentiment, and assent, dwelling
in the body, in the soul, and in the spirit, form a ternary,
which becoming developed under favour of a relative unity
constitutes the human quaternary, or Man considered
abstractly. The three affections which compose this ternary
act and react upon one another, and become mutually
enlightened or obscured; and the unity which binds them,
that is to say, Man, is perfected or depraved, according as
it tends to become blended with the Universal Unity or to
become distinguished from it. The means that this ternary
has of becoming blended with it, or of becoming distinguished
from it, of approaching near or of drawing away from it,
resides wholly in its Will, which, through the use that it
makes of the instruments furnished it by the body, soul,
and mind, becomes instinctive or stupefied; is made virtuous
or vicious, wise or ignorant, and places itself in condition
to perceive with more or less energy, to understand and to
judge with more or less rectitude what there is of goodness,
excellence, and justice in sensation, sentiment, or assent;
to distinguish, with more or less force and knowledge, good
and evil; and not to be deceived at last in what is really
pleasure or pain, love or hatred, truth or error.</p>

<p>Indeed one feels that the metaphysical doctrine that
I have just briefly set forth is nowhere found so clearly
expressed, and therefore I do not need to support it with any
direct authority. It is only by adopting the principles set
down in the Golden Verses and by meditating a long time
upon what has been written by Pythagoras that one is
able to conceive the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(ensemble)</i>. The disciples of this philosopher
having been extremely discreet and often obscure,
one can only well appreciate the opinions of their master
by throwing light upon them with those of the Platonists
and Stoics, who have adopted and spread them without any
reserve.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_378" id="fnanchor_378"></a><a href="#footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Man, such as I have just depicted him, according to
the idea that Pythagoras had conceived, placed under the
dominion of Providence between the past and the future,
endowed with a free will by his essence, and being carried
along toward virtue or vice with its own movement, Man,
I say, should understand the source of the evils that he
necessarily experiences; and far from accusing this same
Providence which dispenses good and evil to each according
to his merit and his anterior actions, can blame only himself
if he suffers, through an inevitable consequence of his past
mistakes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_379" id="fnanchor_379"></a><a href="#footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></span>
For Pythagoras admitted many successive
existences,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_380" id="fnanchor_380"></a><a href="#footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></span>
and maintained that the present, which strikes us, and
the future, which menaces us, are only the expression of the
past which has been our work in anterior times. He said that
the greater part of men lose, in returning to life, the remembrance
of these past existences; but that, concerning himself,
he had, by a particular favour of the gods, preserved the
memory of them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_381" id="fnanchor_381"></a><a href="#footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></span>
Thus according to his doctrine, this
fatal Necessity, of which man unceasingly complains, has
been created by himself through the use of his will; he
traverses, in proportion as he advances in time, the road that
he has already traced for himself; and according as he has
modified it by good or evil, as he sows so to speak, his virtues
or his vices, he will find it again more smooth or laborious,
when the time will come to traverse it anew.</p>

<p>These are the dogmas by means of which Pythagoras
established the necessity of Destiny, without harming the
power of the Will, and left to Providence its universal empire,
without being obliged either to attribute to it the origin
of evil, as those who admitted only one principle of things,
or to give to evil an absolute existence, as those who admitted
two principles. In this, he was in accordance with
the ancient doctrine which was followed by the oracles of
the gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_382" id="fnanchor_382"></a><a href="#footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></span>
The Pythagoreans, however, did not regard
pain, that is to say, whatever afflicts the body in its mortal
life, as veritable evils; they called veritable evils only sins,
vices, and errors into which one falls voluntarily. In their
opinion, the physical and inevitable evils being illustrated
by the presence of virtue, could be transformed into blessings
and become distinguished and
enviable.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_383" id="fnanchor_383"></a><a href="#footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></span>
These last
evils, dependent upon necessity, Lysis commended to be
judged for what they were; that is, to consider as an inevitable
consequence of some mistake, as the chastisement
or remedy for some vice; and therefore to endure them, and
far from irritating them further by impatience and anger,
on the contrary to modify them by the resignation and acquiescence
of the will to the judgment of Providence. He
does not forbid, as one sees in the lines cited, assuaging
them by lawful means; on the contrary, he desires that the
sage should apply himself to diverting them if possible, and
healing them. Thus this philosopher did not fall into the
excess with which the Stoics have been justly
reproached.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_384" id="fnanchor_384"></a><a href="#footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></span>
He considered pain evil, not that it was of the same nature
as vice, but because its nature, a purgative for vice, makes
it a necessary consequence. Plato adopted this idea, and
made all the inferences felt with his customary
eloquence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_385" id="fnanchor_385"></a><a href="#footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>As to what Lysis said, always following Pythagoras,
that the sage was never exposed to the crudest evils, this
can be understood as Hierocles has understood it, in a simple
and natural manner, or in a more mysterious manner as I
stated. It is evident at once, in following the inferences of
the principles which have been given, that the sage is not,
in reality, subject to the severest evils, since, not aggravating
by his emotions those which the necessity of destiny
inflict upon him, and bearing them with resignation, he
alleviates them; living happy, even in the midst of misfortune,
in the firm hope that these evils will no more trouble
his days, and certain that the divine blessings which are
reserved for virtue, await him in another
life.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_386" id="fnanchor_386"></a><a href="#footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></span>
Hierocles,
after having revealed this first manner of explaining the
verse in question, touches lightly upon the second, in saying
that the Will of man can have an influence on Providence,
when, acting in a lofty soul, it is assisted by succour from
heaven and operates with
it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_387" id="fnanchor_387"></a><a href="#footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></span>
This was a part of the
doctrine taught in the mysteries, whose divulgence to the
profane was forbidden. According to this doctrine, of
which sufficiently strong traces can be recognized in
Plato,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_388" id="fnanchor_388"></a><a href="#footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span>
the Will, exerting itself by faith, was able to subjugate
Necessity itself, to command Nature, and to work miracles.
It was the principle upon which was founded the magic
of the disciples of
Zoroaster.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_389" id="fnanchor_389"></a><a href="#footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></span>
Jesus saying parabolically,
that by means of faith one could remove
mountains,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_390" id="fnanchor_390"></a><a href="#footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></span>
only spoke according to the theosophical traditions known
to all the sages. “The uprightness of the heart and faith
triumphs over all obstacles,” said
Kong-Tse<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_391" id="fnanchor_391"></a><a href="#footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></span>;
“all men
can render themselves equal to the sages and to the heroes
whose memory the nations revere,” said Meng-Tse; “it is
never the power which is lacking, it is the will; provided
one desire, one succeeds.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_392" id="fnanchor_392"></a><a href="#footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></span>
These ideas of the Chinese
theosophists are found in the writings of the
Indians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_393" id="fnanchor_393"></a><a href="#footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></span>
and even in those of some Europeans who, as I have already
observed, had not enough erudition to be imitators. “The
greater the will,” said Boehme, “the greater the being and
the more powerfully inspired.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_394" id="fnanchor_394"></a><a href="#footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></span>
“Will and liberty are
the same thing.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_395" id="fnanchor_395"></a><a href="#footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></span>
“It is the source of light, the magic
which makes something from
nothing.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_396" id="fnanchor_396"></a><a href="#footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Will which goes resolutely forward is faith; it models its
own form in spirit and overcomes all things; by it, a soul receives
the power of carrying its influence in another soul, and of penetrating
its most intimate essences. When it acts with God it can
overthrow mountains, break the rocks, confound the plots of the
impious, and breathe upon them disorder and dismay; it can
effect all prodigies, command the heavens, the sea, and enchain
death itself: it subjugates all. Nothing can be named that cannot
be commanded in the name of the Eternal. The soul which
executes these great things only imitates the prophets and the
saints, Moses, Jesus, and the apostles. All the elect have a
similar power. Evil disappears before them. Nothing can harm
the one in whom God
dwells.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_397" id="fnanchor_397"></a><a href="#footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in departing from this doctrine, taught as I have
said in the mysteries, that certain gnostics of the Alexandrian
school assert that evils never attended the true sages, if
there were found men who might have been so in reality;
for Providence, image of divine justice, would never allow
the innocent to suffer and be punished. Basil, who was
one of those who supported this Platonic
opinion,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_398" id="fnanchor_398"></a><a href="#footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></span>
was
sharply reprimanded by the orthodox Christians, who treated
him as a heretic, quoting to him the example of the martyrs.
Basil replied that the martyrs were not entirely innocent,
because there is no man exempt from faults; that God punishes
in them, either evil desires, actual and secret sins, or
sins that the soul had committed in a previous existence;
and as they did not fail to oppose him again with the example
of Jesus, who, although fully innocent, had, however,
suffered the torture of the cross, Basil answered without
hesitation that God had been just, in his opinion, and that
Jesus, being man, was no more than another exempt from
sin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_399" id="fnanchor_399"></a><a href="#footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">13. <i>Even as Truth, does Error have its lovers;<br />
            &ensp;With prudence the Philosopher approves or blames;<br />
            &ensp;If Error triumph, he departs and waits.</i></p>

<p>It is sufficiently known that Pythagoras was the first
who used the word Philosopher to designate <i>a friend of
wisdom.</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_400" id="fnanchor_400"></a><a href="#footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span>
Before him, the word <i>Sophos</i>, sage, was used. It
is therefore with intention that I have made it enter into
my translation, although it may not be literally in the text.
The portrayal that Lysis gives of the philosopher represents
everything in moderation and in that just mean, where the
celebrated Kong-Tse placed also the perfection of the
sage.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_401" id="fnanchor_401"></a><a href="#footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></span>
He commended to him tolerance for the opinions of others,
instilling in him that, as truth and error have likewise their
followers, one must not be flattered into thinking that one
can enlighten all men, nor bring them to accept the same
sentiments and to profess the same doctrine. Pythagoras
had, following his custom, expressed these same ideas by
symbolic phrases: “Exceed not the balance,” he had said,
“stir not the fire with the sword,” “all materials are not
fitting to make a statue of Mercury.” That is to say, avoid
all excess; depart not from the golden mean which is the
appanage of the philosopher; propagate not your doctrine
by violent means; use not the sword in the cause of God and
the truth; confide not science to a corrupt soul; or as Jesus
forcibly said: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
neither cast ye your pearls before
swine”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_402" id="fnanchor_402"></a><a href="#footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></span>;
for all men
are not equally fitted to receive science, to become models
of wisdom, nor to reflect the image of God.</p>

<p>Pythagoras, it must be said, had not always entertained
these sentiments. While he was young and while he still
burned unconsciously with the fire of passions, he abandoned
himself to a blind and vehement zeal. An excess of
enthusiasm and of divine love had thrown him into intolerance
and perhaps he would have become persecutor, if,
like Mohammed, he had had the weapons at hand. An
incident opened his eyes. As he had contracted the habit
of treating his disciples very severely, and as he generally
censured men for their vices with much asperity, it happened
one day that a youth, whose mistakes he had publicly
exposed and whom he had upbraided with bitterest reproaches,
conceived such despair that he killed himself.
The philosopher never thought of this evil of which he had
been the cause without violent grief; he meditated deeply,
and made from this incident reflections which served him the
remainder of his life. He realized, as he energetically
expressed it, that one must not stir the fire with the sword.
One can, in this regard, compare him with Kong-Tse and
Socrates. The other theosophists have not always shown
the same moderation. Krishna, the most tolerant among
them had nevertheless said, abandoning himself to thoughtless
enthusiasm: “Wisdom consists in being wholly for
Me … in freedom from love of self … in loosening all
bonds of attachment for one’s children, wife, and home …
in rendering to God alone a steadfast cult … disdaining
and fleeing from the society of
men”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_403" id="fnanchor_403"></a><a href="#footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></span>:
words remarkable
for the connection that they have with those of Jesus:
“If any man come to me and hate not his father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
his own life also, he cannot be my
disciple.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_404" id="fnanchor_404"></a><a href="#footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></span>
Zoroaster
seemed to authorize persecution, saying in an outburst of
indignation: “He who does evil, destroy him; rise up against
all those who are cruel.… Smite with strength the
proud Turanian who afflicts and torments the
just.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_405" id="fnanchor_405"></a><a href="#footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></span>
One
knows to what pitch of wrath Moses was kindled against
the Midianites and the other peoples who resisted
him,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_406" id="fnanchor_406"></a><a href="#footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></span>
notwithstanding that he had announced, in a calmer moment,
the God of Israel as a God merciful and gracious, long-suffering
and abundant in goodness and
truth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_407" id="fnanchor_407"></a><a href="#footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></span>
Mohammed,
as passionate as Moses, and strongly resembling the legislator
of the Hebrews by his ability and firmness, has fallen
into the same excess. He has often depicted, as cruel and
inexorable, this same God whom he invokes at the head of
all of his writings, as very good, very just, and very
clement.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_408" id="fnanchor_408"></a><a href="#footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></span>
This proves how rare a thing it is to remain in the golden
mean so commended by Kong-Tse and Pythagoras, how
difficult it is for any pupil to resist the lure of the passions
to stifle utterly their voice, in order to hear only the voice
of the divine inspiration. Reflecting upon the discrepancies
of the great men whom I have just cited, one cannot refrain
from thinking with Basil, that, in effect, there are no men
on earth veritably wise and without
sin<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_409" id="fnanchor_409"></a><a href="#footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></span>;
above all when
one considers that Jesus expressed himself in the same details
as Krishna, Zoroaster, and Moses; and that he who had
exhorted us in one passage to love our enemies, to do good
to those who hate us, and to pray even for those who persecute
and calumniate us,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_410" id="fnanchor_410"></a><a href="#footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></span>

<p>Lysis continues, in the name of Pythagoras, to trace
for the philosopher the course that he must follow in the
first part of his doctrine, which is the Purification. After
having commended to him moderation and prudence in
all things, having exhorted him to be as slow to censure as
to approve, he seeks to put him on guard against prejudices
and the routine of example, which are, in reality, the greatest
obstacles that are encountered by science and truth. This
is what Bacon, the regenerator of philosophy in modern
Europe, so keenly felt, as I have already cited with praise
at the opening of this work. This excellent observer, to
whom we owe our freedom from scholastic leading-strings
whose ignorance had stifled for us the name of Aristotle,
having formed the difficult enterprise of disencumbering
and, as it were, clearing the air belonging to the human
understanding, in order to put it in a condition to receive
an edifice less barbarous, remarked, that one would never
attain to establishing there the foundation of true science,
if one did not first labour to set aside
prejudices.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_415" id="fnanchor_415"></a><a href="#footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></span>
He
displayed all his forces against these formidable enemies of
human perfectibility, and if he did not overthrow them all,
at least he indicated them in such a manner as to make it
easier to recognize and destroy them. The prejudices
which obsess the human understanding and which he calls
idols, are, according to him, of four kinds: these are the
idols of the tribe; the idols of the den; the idols of society;
and the idols of theories. The first are inherent in human
nature; the second are those of each individual; the third
result from the equivocal definitions attached to words;
the fourth and the most numerous are those that man
receives from his teachers and from the doctrines which
are current.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_416" id="fnanchor_416"></a><a href="#footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></span>
The last are the most tenacious and the
most difficult to conquer. It seems even impossible wholly
to resist them. The man who aspires to the perilous glory
of improving the human mind, finds himself placed between
two formidable dangers, which, like those of Sylla
and Charybdis, threaten alternately to break his frail bark:
upon one is irresistible routine, upon the other proud innovation.
There is danger alike from both sides. He can
save himself only by favour of the golden mean, so commended
by all the sages and so rarely followed even by them.</p>

<p>This golden mean must needs be very difficult to hold
in the course of life, since Kong-Tse himself, who has made
it all his study, has lacked it in the most important part of
his doctrine, in that concerning human perfectibility. Imbued
unknowingly with the prejudices of his nation, he
has seen nothing beyond the doctrine of the ancients and
has not believed that anything might be added
thereunto.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_417" id="fnanchor_417"></a><a href="#footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></span>
Instead of pushing the mind of the Chinese forward toward
the goal where nature unceasingly tends, which is the perfection
of all things, he has, on the contrary, thrown it
backward and, inspiring it with a fanatical respect for works
of the past, has prevented it from meditating upon anything
great for the
future.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_418" id="fnanchor_418"></a><a href="#footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></span>
Filial piety itself, pushed, to excess
changed to a blind imitation, has also augmented the evil.
So that the greatest people of the world, the richest in principles
of all kinds, not daring to draw from these same
principles any development, through fear of profaning them,
continually on their knees before a sterile antiquity, have
remained stationary, whereas all around is progression;
and for nearly four thousand years have really not advanced
a step more towards the civilization and perfection of the
arts and sciences.</p>

<p>The side on which Bacon has departed from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(juste
milieu)</i> has been precisely the opposite from that which
prevented Kong-Tse from remaining there. The Chinese
theosophist had been led astray by his excessive veneration
for antiquity and the English philosopher, by his profound
disdain for it. Warned against the doctrine of Aristotle,
Bacon has extended his prejudice to everything that came
from the ancients. Rejecting in a moment the labour of
thirty centuries and the fruit of the meditation of the greatest
geniuses, he has wished to admit nothing beyond what
experience could confirm in his
eyes.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_419" id="fnanchor_419"></a><a href="#footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></span>

Here indeed is
a case of returning again to the idea of Basil, and of exclaiming
with him, that no man is without sin. Kong-Tse has
been unquestionably one of the greatest men who has honoured
the earth, and Bacon one of the most judicious philosophers
of Europe; both have, however, committed grave
mistakes whose effect is more or less felt by posterity: the
former, filling the Chinese <i>literati</i> with an exaggerated respect
for antiquity, has made of it an immobile and almost
inert mass, that Providence, in order to obtain certain
necessary movements, has had to strike many times with the
terrible scourge of revolutions; the latter, inspiring, on the
contrary, a thoughtless contempt for everything that came
from the ancients, demanding the proof of their principles,
the reason for their dogmas, subjecting all to the light of
experience, has broken the scientific body, has deprived it
of unity, and has transformed the assemblage of thinkers
into a tumultuous anarchy from whose irregular movement
has sprung enough violent storms. If Bacon had been
able to effect in Europe the same influence that Kong-Tse
had effected in China, he would have drawn philosophy into
materialism and absolute empiricism. Happily the remedy
is born of the evil itself. The lack of unity has taken away
all force from the anarchical colossus. Each supposing
to be in the right, no one was. A hundred systems raised
one upon the other clashed and were broken in turn. Experience,
invoked by all parties, has taken all colours and
its opposed judgments were self-destructive.</p>

<p>If, after having called attention to the mistakes of these
great men, I dared to hazard my opinion upon the point
where both of them have failed, I would say that they have
confused the principles of the sciences with their developments;
it must be so, by drawing the principles from the
past, as Kong-Tse; by allowing the developments to act
throughout the future, as Bacon. Principles hold to the
Necessity of things; they are immutable in themselves;
finite, inaccessible to the senses, they are proved by reason:
their developments proceed from the power of the Will;
these developments are free, indefinite; they affect the senses
and are demonstrated by experience. Never is the development
of a principle finished in the past, as Kong-Tse
believed; never is a principle created in the future, as Bacon
imagined. The development of a principle produces another
principle, but always in the past; and as soon as this new
principle is laid down, it is universal and beyond the reach
of experience. Man knows that this principle exists, but
he knows not how. If he knew, he would be able to create
it at his pleasure; which does not belong to his nature.</p>

<p>Man develops, perfects, or depraves, but he creates
nothing. The scientific golden mean commended by Pythagoras,
consists therefore, in seizing the principles of the
sciences where they are and developing them freely without
being constrained or driven by any false ideas. As to that
which concerns morals, it is forcibly enough expressed by
all that has preceded.</p>

<p>The man who recognizes his dignity, says Hierocles,
is incapable of being prejudiced or seduced by
anything.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_427" id="fnanchor_427"></a><a href="#footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></span>
Temperance and force are the two incorruptible guardians
of the soul: they prevent it from yielding to the allurements
of things pleasing and being frightened by the horrors of
things dreadful. Death suffered in a good cause is illustrious
and glorious.</p>

<p class="p2">15. <i>Consult, deliberate, and freely choose.</i></p>

<p>In explaining this line from a moral standpoint as Hierocles
has done, one readily feels that to deliberate and choose
in that which relates to moral conduct, consists in seeking
for what is good or evil in an action, and in attaching oneself
to it or fleeing from it, without letting oneself be drawn
along by the lure of pleasure or the fear of
pain.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_428" id="fnanchor_428"></a><a href="#footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span>
But if
one penetrates still deeper into the meaning of this line, it
is seen that it proceeds from principles previously laid down
regarding the necessity of Destiny and the power of the
Will; and that Pythagoras neglected no opportunity for
making his disciples feel that, although forced by Destiny
to find themselves in such or such a condition, they remained
free to weigh the consequences of their action, and to decide
themselves upon the part that they ought to take. The
following lines are, as it were, the corollary of his counsel.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">16. <i>Let fools act aimlessly and without cause,<br />
            &ensp;Thou shouldst, in the present, contemplate the future.</i></p>

<p>That is to say, thou shouldst consider what will be the
results of such or such action and think that these results,
dependent upon thy will (while the action remains in suspense
and free, while they are yet to be born), will become
the domain of Necessity the very instant when the action
will be executed, and increasing in the past, once they shall
have had birth, will coöperate in forming the plan of a new
future.</p>

<p>I beg the reader, interested in these sorts of comparisons,
to reflect a moment upon the idea of Pythagoras. He will
find here the veritable source of the astrological science of
the ancients. Doubtless he is not ignorant of what an
extended influence this science exercised already upon the
face of the globe. The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Phœnicians,
did not separate it from that which regulated the cult of
the gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_429" id="fnanchor_429"></a><a href="#footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></span>
Their temples were but an abridged image of
the Universe, and the tower which served as an observatory
was raised at the side of the sacrificial altar. The
Peruvians followed, in this respect, the same usages as
the Greeks and Romans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_430" id="fnanchor_430"></a><a href="#footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>
Everywhere the grand Pontiff
united the science of genethlialogy or astrology with the
priesthood, and concealed with care the principles of this
science within the precincts of the
sanctuary.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_431" id="fnanchor_431"></a><a href="#footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></span>
It was

Rome,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_432" id="fnanchor_432"></a><a href="#footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>

Japan.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_433" id="fnanchor_433"></a><a href="#footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></span>

worthy to be initiated.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_434" id="fnanchor_434"></a><a href="#footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></span>
For one need only lay aside an
instant the bandage of prejudice to see that an Universal
science, linked throughout to what men recognize as the
most holy, can not be the product of folly and stupidity,
as has been reiterated a hundred times by a host of moralists.
All antiquity is certainly neither foolish nor stupid, and the
sciences it cultivated were supported by principles which,
for us today, being wholly unknown, have none the less
existed. Pythagoras, if we give attention here, revealed
to us those of genethlialogy and of all the sciences of divination
which relate thereunto.</p>

<p>Let us observe this closely. The future is composed of
the past&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, that the route that man traverses
in time, and that he modifies by means of the power of his
will, he has already traversed and modified; in the same
manner, using a practical illustration, that the earth describing
its annual orbit around the sun, according to the modern
system, traverses the same spaces and sees unfold around it
almost the same aspects: so that, following anew a route
that he has traced for himself, man would be able not only
to recognize the imprints of his steps, but to foresee the
objects that he is about to encounter, since he has already
seen them, if his memory preserved the image, and if this
image was not effaced by the necessary consequence of his
nature and the providential laws which rule him. Such is
the doctrine of Pythagoras as I have already
revealed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_435" id="fnanchor_435"></a><a href="#footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></span>
It was that of the mysteries and of all the sages of antiquity.
Origen, who has opposed it, attributes it to the Egyptians,
to the Pythagoreans, and to the disciples of Plato. It was
contained in the sacred books of the Chaldeans, cited by
Syncellus, under the title of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(livres
géniques)</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_436" id="fnanchor_436"></a><a href="#footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></span>
Seneca and
Synesius have supported it as wholly in accordance with
the spirit of the
initiations.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_437" id="fnanchor_437"></a><a href="#footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></span>
What the ancients called
the <em>great year</em>, was a consequence of this doctrine; for it was
taught in the mysteries, that the Universe itself traversed,
after a sequence of incalculable centuries, the same revolutions
that it had already traversed, and brought around in
the vast unfolding of its concentric spheres, as much for it
as for the worlds which compose it, the succession of the
four ages, the duration of which, relative to the nature of
each being, immense for the Universal Man, is limited in
the individual to what is called infancy, youth, manhood,
and old age, and is represented on the earth by the fleeting
seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. This great
year, thus conceived, has been common to all the peoples
of the earth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_438" id="fnanchor_438"></a><a href="#footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></span>
Cicero has plainly seen that it constituted
the veritable basis of genethlialogy or the astrological
science.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_439" id="fnanchor_439"></a><a href="#footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></span>
Indeed if the future is composed of the past&mdash;&#8203;that
is, a thing already made, upon which the present is gradually
unfolded as upon the circumference of a circle which has
neither beginning nor end, it is evident that one can succeed,
up to a certain point, to recognize it, whether by means of
remembrance, by examining in the past, the picture of the
whole revolution; or by means of prevision carrying the
moral sight, more or less far, upon the route through which
the Universe is passing. These two methods have grave
disadvantages. The first appears even impossible. For
what is the duration of the great year? What is the immense
period, which, containing the circle of all possible aspects
and of all corresponding effects, as Cicero supposes, is able,
by observations made and set down in the genethliatic
archives, to foresee, at the second revolution, the return of
the events which were already linked there and which must
be reproduced?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_440" id="fnanchor_440"></a><a href="#footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></span>
Plato exacts, for the perfection of this
great year, that the movement of the fixed stars, which
constitutes what we call the precession of the equinoxes,
should coincide with the particular movement of the celestial
bodies, so as to bring back the heavens to the fixed
point of its primitive
position.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_441" id="fnanchor_441"></a><a href="#footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></span>
The Brahmans carry
the greatest duration of this immense period, which they
name <i>Kalpa</i>, to 4,320,000,000 of years, and its mean duration,
which they name <i>Maha-Youg</i>, to
4,320,000.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_442" id="fnanchor_442"></a><a href="#footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></span>
The
Chinese appear to restrict it to 432,000
years,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_443" id="fnanchor_443"></a><a href="#footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></span>
and in
this they agree with the Chaldeans; but when one reduces
it again to a twelfth of this number, with the Egyptians,
that is, to the sole revolution of the fixed stars, which they
made, according to Hipparchus, 36,000 years, and which
we make no more than 25,867, according to modern
calculations,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_444" id="fnanchor_444"></a><a href="#footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></span>

we feel indeed that we would be still very far from
having a series of observations capable of making us foresee
the return of the same events, and that we could not conceive
even, how men could ever attain to its mastery. As
to the second method, which consists, as I have said, in
carrying forward the moral sight upon the route which one
has before him, I have no need to observe that it can be
only very conjectural and very uncertain, since it depends
upon a faculty which man has never possessed except as a
special favour of Providence.</p>

<p>The principle by which it is claimed that the future is
only a return of the past, did not therefore suffice to recognize
even the plan of it; a second principle is necessary, and
this principle, openly announced in the Golden Verses, as
we shall see farther on, was that by which it was established
that Nature is everywhere alike, and, consequently, that its
action, being uniform in the smallest sphere as in the greatest,
in the highest as in the lowest, can be inferred from both,
and pronounced by analogy. This principle proceeded
from the ancient dogma concerning the animation of the
Universe, as much in general as in particular: a dogma consecrated
among all nations, and following which it was taught
that not only the Great All, but the innumerable worlds
which are like its members, the heavens and the heaven
of heavens, the stars and all the beings who people them
even to the plants and metals, are penetrated by the same
Soul and moved by the same
Spirit.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_445" id="fnanchor_445"></a><a href="#footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></span>
Stanley attributes this
dogma to the Chaldeans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_446" id="fnanchor_446"></a><a href="#footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></span>
Kircher to the Egyptians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_447" id="fnanchor_447"></a><a href="#footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></span>
and
the wise Rabbi Maimonides traces it back to the
Sabæans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_448" id="fnanchor_448"></a><a href="#footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></span>
Saumaise has attributed to them the origin of astrological
science,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_449" id="fnanchor_449"></a><a href="#footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></span>
and he is correct in one point. But of what use
is it to consider the movement of the heavens and the respective
position of the stars belonging to the same sphere
as the earth, in order to form the genethliatical theme of the
empires of nations, cities, and even of simple individuals,
and conclude from the point of departure in the temporal
route of existence, the aim of this route and the fortunate
or unfortunate events with which they should be sown, if
one had not established, primarily, that this route, being only
some portion of an existing sphere and already traversed,
it belonged thus to the domain of Necessity and could be
known; and, secondarily, that the analogical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(rapport)</i> ruling
between the sentient sphere that one examined and the
intelligible sphere that one could not perceive, authorized
drawing inferences from both and even deciding from the
general to the particular? For, believing that the stars
have an actual and direct influence upon the destiny of
peoples and of men, and that they even determine this
destiny by their good or evil aspects, is an idea as false as
ridiculous, born of the darkness of modern times, and that
is not found among the ancients, even among the most
ignorant masses. The genethliatical science is supported
by principles less absurd. These principles, drawn from
the mysteries, were, as I have explained, that the future is
a return of the past and that nature is everywhere the same.</p>

<p>It is from the union of these two principles that resulted
genethlialogy, or the science by which the point of departure
being known in any sphere whatever, they believed
they had discovered, by the aspect and direction of the
stars, the portion of this sphere which must immediately
follow this point. But this union, outside of the enormous
difficulty that it presented, still involved in its execution
very dangerous consequences. This is why they concealed
in the sanctuaries the science which was its object, and made
of religion a secret and state affair. The prevision of the
future, supposing it possible as the ancients did, is not, in
effect, a science that one should abandon to the vulgar, who,
being unable to acquire previously the learning necessary,
and having but rarely the wisdom which regulates its use,
risked debasing it, or making use of it wrongfully. Furthermore,
the pontiffs, who were in sole charge, initiated in the
great mysteries and possessing the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(ensemble)</i> of the doctrine,
knew very well that the future, such even as they could
hope to understand it in the perfection of the science, was
never aught but a doubtful future, a sort of canvas upon
which the power of the Will might exercise itself freely, in
such a manner that, although the matter might be determined
beforehand, its form was not, and that such an imminent
event could be suspended, evaded, or changed by a
coöperation of the acts of the will, inaccessible to all prevision.
This is what was said with such profoundness by
Tiresias, the most famous hierophant of Greece and whom
Homer called the only
sage,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_450" id="fnanchor_450"></a><a href="#footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></span>
these words so often quoted
and so little understood: “Whatever I may see will come
to pass, or it will not come to
pass”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_451" id="fnanchor_451"></a><a href="#footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></span>;
that is to say, The
event that I see is in the necessity of Destiny and it will
come to pass, unless it is changed by the power of the Will;
in which case it will not come to pass.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">17. <i>That which thou dost not know, pretend not that thou dost.<br />
      Instruct thyself: for time and patience favour all.</i></p>

<p>Lysis has enclosed in these two lines the summary of
the doctrine of Pythagoras regarding science: according to
this philosopher, all science consists of knowing how to
distinguish what one does not know and of desiring to learn
that of which one knows
nothing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_452" id="fnanchor_452"></a><a href="#footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></span>
Socrates had adopted
this idea, as simple as profound; and Plato has consecrated
several of his dialogues to its
development.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_453" id="fnanchor_453"></a><a href="#footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>But the distinction between what one does not know
and the desire to learn that of which one is ignorant, is
a thing much rarer than one imagines. It is the golden
mean of science, as difficult to possess as that of virtue, and
without which it is, however, impossible to know oneself.
For, without knowledge of oneself, how can one acquire
knowledge of others? How judge them if one cannot be
one’s own judge? Pursue this reasoning. It is evident
that one can know only what one has learned from others,
or what one has found from oneself: in order to have learned
from others, one must have wished to receive lessons; in
order to have found, one must have wished to seek; but
one cannot reasonably desire to learn or to seek only for
what one believes one does not know. If one imposes upon
oneself this important point, and if one imagines oneself
knowing that of which one is ignorant, one must judge it
wholly useless to learn or to seek, and then ignorance is
incurable: it is madness to style oneself doctor concerning
things that one has neither learned nor sought after, and of
which one can consequently have no knowledge. It is Plato
who has made this irresistible reasoning, and who has drawn
this conclusion: that all the mistakes that man commits come
from that sort of ignorance which makes him believe that
he knows what he does not
know.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_454" id="fnanchor_454"></a><a href="#footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>From time immemorial this sort of ignorance has been
quite considerable; but I believe that it will never again
show itself to the extent it did among us some centuries
ago. Men hardly free from the mire of barbarism, without
being given the time either to acquire or to seek after any
true knowledge of antiquity, have offered themselves boldly
as its judges and have declared that the great men who have
made it illustrious were either ignorant, imposters, fanatics,
or fools. Here, I see musicians who seriously assure me
that the Greeks were rustics in the way of music; that all
that can be said of the wonders effected by this art is idle
talk, and that we have not a village fiddler who could not
produce as much effect as Orpheus, Terpander, or Timotheus,
if he had similar
auditors.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_455" id="fnanchor_455"></a><a href="#footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></span>
There, are the critics who
tell me with the same phlegmatic air that the Greeks of the
time of Homer knew neither how to read nor how to write;
that this poet himself, assuming that he really existed, did
not know the letters of the
alphabet<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_456" id="fnanchor_456"></a><a href="#footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></span>;
but that his existence
is a fancy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_457" id="fnanchor_457"></a><a href="#footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></span>
and that the works attributed to him
are the crude productions of certain plagiarist
rhapsodists.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_458" id="fnanchor_458"></a><a href="#footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></span>
Further on I see, to complete the singularity, a research
worker who finds, doubtless to the support of all this, that
the first editor of the poems of Homer, the virile legislator
of Sparta, Lycurgus in short, was a man ignorant and unlettered,
knowing neither how to read nor
write<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_459" id="fnanchor_459"></a><a href="#footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></span>:
quite
an original idea and a comparison wholly bizarre, between
the author and the editor of the <cite>Iliad</cite>! But this is nothing.
Here is an archbishop of Thessalonica, who, animated by a
righteous indignation, declared that Homer may have been
an instrument of the
devil,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_460" id="fnanchor_460"></a><a href="#footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></span>
and that one may be damned
in reading him. That one shrugs the shoulders at the allegories
of this poet, that one finds them not in the least interesting,
that one falls asleep even, let all that pass; but
to be damned! I have said that Bacon, drawn along unfortunately
by that fatal prejudice which makes one judge
without understanding, had calumniated the philosophy
of the Greeks; his numerous disciples have even surpassed
him upon this point. Condillac, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(coryphée)</i> of modern
empiricism, has seen in Plato only delirious metaphysics
unworthy of occupying his time, and in Zeno only logic
deprived of reasoning and principles. I would that Condillac,
so great an amateur of analysis, had endeavoured to
analyse the metaphysics of the one and the logic of the other,
to prove to me that he understood at least what he found so
unworthy of taking up his time; but that was the thing
about which he thought the least. Open whatever book
you will; if the authors are theologians, they will say to you
that Socrates, Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Kong-Tse or Confucius,
as they call him, are
pagans,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_461" id="fnanchor_461"></a><a href="#footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></span>
whose damnation is, if not
certain, at least very probable; they will treat their theosophy
with the most profound contempt: if they are physicists,
they will assure you that Thales, Leucippus, Heraclitus,
Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Aristotle, and the
others are miserable dreamers; they will jeer at their systems:
if they are astronomers, they will laugh at their astronomy:
if they are naturalists, chemists, botanists, they will make
jest of their methods, and will take into consideration their
credulity, their stupidity, their bad faith, the numerous
wonders that they no longer understand in Aristotle and
in Pliny. None will take the trouble to prove their assertions;
but, like people blinded by passion and ignorance,
they state as fact what is in question, or putting their own
ideas in place of those that they do not understand they
will create phantoms for the sake of fighting them. Never
going back to the principles of anything, stopping only at
forms, adopting without examination the commonest notions,
they will commit on all sides the same mistake that
they have committed with respect to the genethliatical
science, the principles of which I have shown in my last
Examination; and confounding this science of the ancients
with the astrology of the moderns, they will consider in
the same light Tiresias and Nostradamus, and will see no
difference between the oracle of Ammon, or of Delphi, and
the lucky chance of the most paltry fortune-teller.</p>

<p>However, I do not pretend to say that all the modern
savants indulge, in this same manner, in presumption and
false notions with regard to antiquity; there have been many
honourable exceptions among them: even those have been
found who, drawn beyond the golden mean, by the necessity
of effecting a useful reform or of establishing a new system,
have returned there as soon as their passion or their interest
have no longer commanded them. Such for example is
Bacon, to whom philosophy has owed enough great favours
to forget certain incidental prejudices; for I am, furthermore,
far from attributing to him the errors of his disciples.
Bacon, at the risk of contradicting himself, yielding to the
sentiment of truth, although he subjected all to the light of
experience, admitted, however, positive and real universals,
which, by his method are wholly
inexplicable.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_462" id="fnanchor_462"></a><a href="#footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></span>
Forgetting
what he had said of Plato in one book, he declared
in another: that this philosopher, endowed with a sublime
genius, turning his attention upon all nature and contemplating
all things from a lofty elevation, had seen very clearly,
in his doctrine of ideas, what the veritable objects of science
are.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_463" id="fnanchor_463"></a><a href="#footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></span>
Finally recognizing the principles of physics and
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(ensemble)</i> of things as the foremost to be considered, he
made astrological science, which he likened to astronomy,
depend upon it, in such a manner as to show that he did
not confound it with vulgar astrology. This philosopher
found that before his time, astronomy, well enough founded
upon phenomena, utterly lacked soundness, and that astrology
had lost its true principles. To be sure he agreed with
astronomy presenting the exterior of celestial phenomena,
that is to say, the number, situation, movement, and periods
of the stars; but he accused it of lacking in understanding
of the physical reasons of these phenomena. He believed
that a single theory which contents itself with appearances
is a very easy thing, and that one can imagine an infinity
of speculations of this sort; also he wished that the science
of astronomy might be further advanced.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Instead of revealing the reasons of celestial phenomena [he
said], one is occupied only with observations and mathematical
demonstrations; for these observations and these demonstrations
can indeed furnish certain ingenious hypotheses to settle all that
in one’s mind, and to make an idea of this assemblage, but not
to know precisely how and why all this is actually in nature:
they indicate, at the most, the apparent movements, the artificial
assemblage, the arbitrary combination of all these phenomena,
but not the veritable causes and the reality of things: and
as to this subject [he continues], it is with very little judgment
that astronomy is ranked among the mathematical sciences;
this classification derogates from its
dignity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_464" id="fnanchor_464"></a><a href="#footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>Regarding astrological science, Bacon wished that it might
be regenerated completely by bringing it back to its real
principles, that is to say, that one should reject all that the
vulgar had added thereto, both narrow and superstitious,
preserving only the grand revolutions of the ancients. These
ideas, as is quite obvious, are not at all in accord with those
that his disciples have adopted since; also the greater part
of them refrain from citing similar passages.</p>

<p class="p2 center">18. <i>Neglect not thy health …</i></p>

<p>I had at first the intention of making here some allusion
to the manner in which Pythagoras and the ancient sages
considered medicine; and I had wished to reveal their principles,
quite different from those of the moderns; but I have
realized that an object so important requires developments
that this work would not allow and I have left them for a
time more opportune, and for a work more suitable. Moreover
the line of Lysis has no need of explanation; it is clear.
This philosopher commends each one to guard his health,
to keep it by temperance and moderation, and if it becomes
impaired, to put himself in condition of not confiding to
another the care of its re-establishment. This precept was
sufficiently understood by the ancients for it to have become
a sort of proverb.</p>

<p>The Emperor Tiberius, who made it a rule of conduct,
said that a man of thirty years or more who called or even
consulted a physician was an ignoramus.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_465" id="fnanchor_465"></a><a href="#footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></span>
It is true
that Tiberius did not add to the precept the exercise of the
temperance that Lysis did not forget to commend in the
following lines, also he lived only seventy-eight years, notwithstanding
the strength of his constitution promised him
a much longer life. Hippocrates of Cos, the father of medicine
in Greece and strongly attached to the doctrine of
Pythagoras, lived one hundred and four years; Xenophile,
Apollonius, Tyanæus, Demonax, and many other Pythagorean
philosophers lived to one hundred and six and one-hundred
and ten years; and Pythagoras himself, although
violently persecuted towards the end of his life, attained to
nearly ninety-nine years according to some and even to the
century mark according to others.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_466" id="fnanchor_466"></a><a href="#footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">19. … <i>Dispense with moderation,<br />
            &ensp;Food to the body, and to the mind repose</i>,</p>

<p>The body, being the instrument of the soul, Pythagoras
desired that one should take reasonable and necessary care
of it in order to hold it always in condition to execute the
behests of the soul. He regarded its preservation as a part
of the purgative virtue.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_467" id="fnanchor_467"></a><a href="#footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">20. <i>Too much attention or too little shun; for envy<br />
            &ensp;Thus, to either excess is alike attached.</i></p>

<p>The philosopher, firm in his principle of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(juste milieu)</i>,
wished that his disciples should avoid excess in all things,
and that they should not draw attention to themselves by
an unusual way of living. It was a widespread opinion among
the ancients, that envy, shameful for the one who felt it
and dangerous for the one who inspired it, had fatal consequences
for both.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_468" id="fnanchor_468"></a><a href="#footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></span>
For envy is attached to all that tends
to distinguish men too ostensibly. Thus, notwithstanding
all that has been published of the extraordinary rules and
severe abstinences that Pythagoras imposed upon his disciples
and that he made them observe, it appears indubitable
that they were only established after his death, and that
his interpreters, being deceived regarding the mysterious
meaning of these symbols, take in the literal sense, what he
had said in the figurative. The philosopher blamed only
the excess, and permitted besides, a moderate usage of all
the foods to which men were accustomed. Even the beans,
for which his disciples later conceived so much abhorrence,
were eaten frequently.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_469" id="fnanchor_469"></a><a href="#footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></span>
He did not forbid absolutely either
wine, or meat, or even fish, whatever may have been asserted
at different times<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_470" id="fnanchor_470"></a><a href="#footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></span>;
though, indeed, those of his
disciples who aspired to the highest perfection abstained
from them<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_471" id="fnanchor_471"></a><a href="#footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></span>;
he represented drunkenness and intemperance
only as odious vices that should be
avoided.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_472" id="fnanchor_472"></a><a href="#footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></span>
He had no
scruples about drinking a little wine himself, and of tasting
the meats set before him at
table,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_473" id="fnanchor_473"></a><a href="#footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></span>
in order to show that
he did not regard them as impure, notwithstanding he preferred
the vegetable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(régime)</i> to all others and that, for the
most part, he restricted himself to it from
choice.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_474" id="fnanchor_474"></a><a href="#footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></span>
Further
on I will return to the mystic meaning of the symbols, by
which he had the appearance of forbidding the use of certain
foods and above all beans.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">21. <i>Luxury and avarice have similar results.<br />
      &ensp;One must choose in all things a mean just and good.</i></p>

<p>Lysis terminates the purgative part of the doctrine of
Pythagoras with the trait which characterizes it in general
and in particular; he has shown the golden mean in virtue
and in science; he has commended it in conduct, he states
in full and says openly that extremes meet; that luxury
and avarice differ not in their effects, and that philosophy
consists in avoiding excess in everything. Hierocles adds
that, to be happy, one must know how, where, when, and how
much to take; and that he who is ignorant of these just
limits is always unhappy and he proves it as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Voluptuousness [he said] is necessarily the effect of an action:
now, if the action is good the voluptuousness remains; if it is
evil the voluptuousness passes and is corrupted. When one does
a shameful thing with pleasure, the pleasure passes and the shame
remains. When one does an excellent thing with great trouble
and labour the pain passes and the excellence alone remains.
Whence it follows necessarily, that the evil life is also bitter and
produces as much sorrow and chagrin as the good life is sweet
and procures joy and
contentment.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_475" id="fnanchor_475"></a><a href="#footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>“As the flame of a torch tends always upward whichever
way one turns it,” said the Indian sages, “thus the man
whose heart is afire with virtue, whatever accident befalls
him, directs himself always toward the end that wisdom
indicates.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_476" id="fnanchor_476"></a><a href="#footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>“Misfortune follows vice, and happiness virtue,” said
the Chinese, “as the echo follows the voice and the shadow

] a celestial
power presents thee to us, an interior force conducts us toward
thee; happy the mortal in whom thou dwellest! he strikes the
goal without effort, a single glance suffices for him to penetrate
the truth. His heart becomes the sanctuary of peace and his
very inclinations protect his innocence. It is granted to the sage
only, to attain to so desirable a state. He who aspires to this
must resolve upon the good and attach himself strongly to it;
he must apply himself to the study of himself, interrogate nature,
examine all things carefully, meditate upon them and allow
nothing to pass unfathomed. Let him develop the faculties of
his soul, let him think with force, let him put energy and firmness
into his actions. Alas! how many men there are who seek virtue
and science, and who stop in the middle of their course, because
the goal keeps them waiting! My studies, they say, leave me
with all my ignorance, all my doubts; my efforts, my labours
enlarge neither my views nor my sagacity; the same clouds hover
over my understanding and obscure it; I feel my forces abandoning
me and my will giving way beneath the weight of the obstacle.
No matter; guard yourself against discouragement; that which

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Perfection</span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">22. <i>Let not sleep e’er close thy tired eyes,<br />
      &ensp;Without thou ask thyself; What have I omitted, and what done?</i></p>

<p>Lysis, after having indicated the route by which Pythagoras
conducted his disciples to virtue, goes on to teach
them the use that this philosopher wished them to make
of this celestial gift, once they had mastered it. Up to
this point it is confined in the purgative part of the doctrine
of his teacher; he now passes to the unitive part,
that is to say, to that which has as object the uniting of
man to the Divinity, by rendering him more and more like
unto the model of all perfection and of all wisdom, which is
God. The sole instrument capable of operating this union
has been placed at his disposition by means of the good usage
that he has made of his will: it is virtue which must serve
him at present to attain truth. Now, Truth is the ultimate
goal of perfection: there is nothing beyond it and nothing
this side of it but error; light springs from it; it is the
soul of God, according to
Pythagoras,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_480" id="fnanchor_480"></a><a href="#footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></span>
and God himself,
according to the legislator of the
Indians.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_481" id="fnanchor_481"></a><a href="#footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>The first precept that Pythagoras gave to his disciples
on entering the course of perfection tended to turn their
thoughts upon themselves, to bring them to interrogate
their actions, their thoughts, their discourse, to question
the motives, to reflect in short upon their exterior movements
and seek thus to know themselves. Knowledge of self
was the most important knowledge of all, that which must
conduct them to all others. I will not weary my readers
by adding anything to what I have already said pertaining
to the importance of this knowledge, and the extreme value
set upon it by the ancients. They know unquestionably
that the morals of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato were
only the development of it and that an inscription in the
temple of Greece, that of Delphi, commended it, after that
of the golden mean, as the very teaching of the God whom
they worshipped there<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_482" id="fnanchor_482"></a><a href="#footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></span>:
<i>Nothing in excess, and know Thyself</i>,
contained in few words the doctrine of the sages,
and presented for their meditation the principles upon
which reposed virtue and wisdom which is its consequence.
Nothing further was necessary to electrify the soul of Heraclitus
and to develop the germs of genius, which until the
moment when he read these two sentences were buried in a
cold inertia.</p>

<p>I will not pause therefore to prove the necessity of a
knowledge without which all other is but doubt and presumption.
I will only examine, in a brief digression, if
this knowledge is possible. Plato, as I have said, made the
whole edifice of his doctrine rest upon it; he taught, according
to Socrates, that ignorance of one’s self involves all
ignorance, all mistakes, all vices, and all misfortunes; whereas
knowledge of one’s self, on the contrary, draws all virtue
and all goodness<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_483" id="fnanchor_483"></a><a href="#footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></span>:
so that it cannot be doubted that this
knowledge might be considered possible, since its impossibility
merely questioned would render its system null and
void. However, as Socrates had said that he knew nothing,
in order to distinguish himself from the sophists of his day
who pretended to know everything; as Plato had constantly
used in his teachings that sort of dialectic which, proceeding
toward truth by doubt, consists in defining things for what
they are, knowing their essence, distinguishing those which
are real from those which are only illusory; and above all
as the favourite maxim of these two philosophers had been
that it was necessary to renounce all manner of prejudices,
not pretending to know that of which one is ignorant, and
giving assent only to clear and evident truths; it came to
pass that the disciples of these great men, having lost sight
of the real spirit of their doctrine, took the means for the
end; and imagining that the perfection of wisdom was in
the doubt which leads to it, established as fundamental
maxim, that the wise man ought neither to affirm nor deny
anything; but to hold his assent suspended between the
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> of each
thing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_484" id="fnanchor_484"></a><a href="#footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></span>
Arcesilaus, who declared
himself the chief of this revolution, was a man of vast intellect,
endowed with much physical and moral means, an
imposing presence, and very
eloquent,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_485" id="fnanchor_485"></a><a href="#footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></span>
but imbued with
that secret terror which prevents concentrating upon the
things that one regards as sacred and forbidden; audacious
and almost impious to all outward appearance, he was, in
reality, timid and
superstitious.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_486" id="fnanchor_486"></a><a href="#footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></span>
Impressed with the
inadequacy of his researches to discover the certainty of
certain principles, his vanity had persuaded him that this
certainty was undiscoverable, since he, Arcesilaus, did not
find it; and his superstition acting in accord with his vanity,
he finally believed that the ignorance of man is an effect of
the will of God; and that, according to the meaning of a passage
from Hesiod that he cited unceasingly, the Divinity has
spread an impenetrable veil between it and the human
understanding.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_487" id="fnanchor_487"></a><a href="#footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></span>
Also he named the effect of this ignorance,
<i>Acatalepsy</i>, that is to say incomprehensibility, or
impossibility to raise the
veil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_488" id="fnanchor_488"></a><a href="#footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></span>
His disciples in great
numbers adopted this incomprehensibility and applied it
to all sorts of subjects; now denying, then affirming the
same thing; placing a principle, and overthrowing it the
next moment; becoming entangled themselves in captious
arguments in order to prove that they knew nothing, and
making for themselves the calamitous glory of ignoring
good and evil, and of being unable to distinguish virtue
from vice.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_489" id="fnanchor_489"></a><a href="#footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></span>
Dismal effect of an early error! Arcesilaus
became the convincing proof of what I have repeated touching
the golden mean and the similitude of extremes: once
having left the path of truth, he became through weakness
and through superstition the head of a crowd of audacious
atheists, who, after having called in question the principles
upon which logic and morals repose, placed there those of
religion and overthrew them. Vainly he essayed to arrest
the movement of which he had been the cause by establishing
two doctrines: the one public, wherein he taught skepticism;
the other secret, wherein he maintained
dogmatism<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_490" id="fnanchor_490"></a><a href="#footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></span>:
the time was no longer favourable for this distinction. All
that he gained was to let another usurp the glory and to
give his name to the new sect of doubters. It was Pyrrho
who had this honour. This man, of a character as firm as
impassive, to whom living or dying was a matter of indifference,
who preferred nothing to something, whom a precipice
opening beneath his feet would be unable to swerve from
his path, gathered under his colours all those who made a
philosophical profession of doubting everything, of recognizing
nowhere the character of truth, and he gave them a
sort of doctrine wherein wisdom was placed in the most
complete uncertainty, felicity in the most absolute inertia,
and genius in the art of stifling all kinds of genius by the
accumulation of contradictory
reasonings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_491" id="fnanchor_491"></a><a href="#footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></span>
Pyrrho had
much contempt for men, as was obvious from the doctrine
which he gave them. He had constantly on his lips this
line of Homer: “Even as are the generations of leaves such
are those likewise of
men.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_492" id="fnanchor_492"></a><a href="#footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>I pause a moment here, in order that the reader may
observe, that although the thought of Hesiod, concerning
the veil that the gods had spread between them and men,
and which gave rise to Arcesilaus establishing his acatalepsy,
had originated in
India,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_493" id="fnanchor_493"></a><a href="#footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></span>
it had never had the same
results there; and this, because the Brahmans, in teaching
that this veil existed and that it even bewildered the vulgar
by a series of illusory phenomena, have never said that it
was impossible to raise it; because this might have been an
attack on the power of the will of man and its perfectibility,
to which they put no limit. We shall see further on that
such was also the idea of Pythagoras. Let us return to the
Skeptics.</p>

<p>The writer to whom we owe a comparative history of
the systems of philosophy, written with thought and impartiality,
has felt keenly that skepticism ought to be considered
under two relations: as skepticism of criticism and
reform, necessary to correct the presumption of the human
mind and to destroy its prejudices; as skepticism absolute
and determined, which confounds in a common proscription
both truth and
error.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_494" id="fnanchor_494"></a><a href="#footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></span>
The first, of which Socrates
gave the example, and which Bacon and Descartes have
revived, is a sort of intellectual remedy that Providence
prepares for healing one of the most fatal maladies of the
human mind, that kind of presumptuous ignorance which
makes one believe that he knows that which he does not
know: the second, which is only the excess and abuse of
the first, is this same remedy transformed into poison by an
aberration of the human reason which transports it beyond
the circumstances which invoke its action, and employs it
to devour itself and to exhaust in their source all the causes
which cooperate in the progress of human
understanding.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_495" id="fnanchor_495"></a><a href="#footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></span>
Arcesilaus was the first to introduce it into the Academy
by exaggerating the maxims of Socrates, and Pyrrho made
a special system of destruction in it, under the name of
<i>Pyrrhonism</i>. This system, welcomed in Greece, soon infected
it with its venom, notwithstanding the vigorous resistance
of Zeno the Stoic, whom Providence had raised up
to oppose its ravages.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_496" id="fnanchor_496"></a><a href="#footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></span>
Carried to Rome by Carneades,
the head of the third academy, it alarmed with its maxims
subversive of public morals, Cato the Censor, who confounding
it with philosophy conceived for it an implacable
hatred.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_497" id="fnanchor_497"></a><a href="#footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></span>
This rigid republican, hearing Carneades speak against
justice, denying the existence of virtues, attacking the
Divine Providence, and questioning the fundamental verities
of religion, held in contempt a science which could bring
forth such arguments.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_498" id="fnanchor_498"></a><a href="#footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></span>
He urged the return of the Greek
philosophy, so that the Roman youth might not be imbued
with its errors; but the evil was done. The destructive
germs that Carneades had left, fermented secretly in the
heart of the State, developed under the first favourable
conditions, increased and produced at last that formidable
colossus, which, after taking possession of the public mind,
having obscured the most enlightened ideas of good and
evil, annihilated religion, and delivered the Republic to
disorder, civil wars, and destruction; and raising itself again
with the Roman Empire, withering the principles of the life
it had received, necessitated the institution of a new cult
and thus was exposed to the incursion of foreign errors and
the arms of the barbarians. This colossus, victim of its
own fury, after having torn and devoured itself was buried
beneath the shams that it had heaped up; Ignorance seated
upon its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(débris)</i> governed Europe, until Bacon and Descartes
came and resuscitating, as much as was possible for them
the Socratic skepticism, endeavoured by its means to turn
minds toward the research of truth. But they might
not have done so well, had they not also awakened certain
remnants of Pyrrhonic skepticism, which, being sustained
with their passions and their prejudices, soon resulted in
bewildering their disciples. This new skepticism, naïve in
Montaigne, dogmatic in Hobbes, disguised in Locke, masterly
in Bayle, paradoxical but seductive in the greater number of
the eighteenth-century writers, hidden now beneath the
surface of what is called Experimental philosophy, lures
the mind on toward a sort of empirical routine, and unceasingly
denying the past, discouraging the future, aims
by all kinds of means to retard the progress of the human
mind. It is no more even the character of truth; and the
proof of this character that the modern skeptics demand
<i>ad infinitum</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_499" id="fnanchor_499"></a><a href="#footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></span>
is the demonstration of the very possibility
of understanding this character and of proving it: a new
subtlety that they have deduced from the unfruitful efforts
that certain thinkers have made recently in Germany, to
give to the possibility of the knowledge of self, a basis which
they have not given.</p>

<p>I will relate in my next Examination, what has hindered
these savants from finding this basis. I must, before terminating
this one, show to my readers how I believe one
can distinguish the two kinds of skepticism of which I have
just spoken. A simple question put to a skeptic philosopher
will indicate whether he belongs to the school of Socrates
or Pyrrho. He must before entering into any discussion
reply clearly to this demand: Do you admit of any difference
whatever between that which is and that which is not? If
the skeptic belongs to the school of Socrates, he will necessarily
admit a difference and he will explain it, which will
make him recognized at once. If on the contrary, he belongs
to that of Pyrrho, he will respond in one of three ways:
either that he admits a difference, or that he admits none,
or that he does not know whether one exists. If he admits
it without explaining it, he is beaten; if he does not admit it,
he falls into absurdity; if he pretends not to distinguish it,
he becomes foolish and ridiculous.</p>

<p>He is beaten, if he admits a difference between that
which is and that which is not; because that difference,
admitted, proves the existence of being; the existence of
being proves that of the skeptic who replies; and that
existence proved, proves all the others, whether one considers
them in him, or outside of him, which is the same thing for
the moment.</p>

<p>He falls into absurdity, if he does not admit any difference
between that which is and that which is not, for then
one can prove to him that 1 is equal to 0, and that the part
is as great as the whole.</p>

<p>He becomes foolish and ridiculous, if he dares to say that
he does not know whether a difference really exists between
that which is, and that which is not; for then one asks him
what he did at the age of six months, at one year, two
years, two weeks ago, yesterday? Whatever he replies, he
will become the object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Behold the Pyrrhonian beaten, that is to say, the one
who professes to doubt everything; since a single acknowledged
difference bringing him irresistibly to a certainty,
and since one certainty militates against all the others, there
is no further doubt; and since, doubting no further, it is
only a question then of knowing what he ought, or ought
not to doubt: this is the true character of the skeptic of the
Socratic School.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">23. <i>Abstain thou if ’tis evil; persevere if good.</i></p>

<p>But although one may bring the absolute skeptic to agree
that a difference between good and evil can indeed exist,
as he is forced to agree that one does exist between that
which is and that which is not, just as I have demonstrated
in my preceding Examination; would he not be right in
saying, that to know in general, that good and evil can differ
and consequently exist separately, does not prevent confounding
them in particular; and that he can doubt that
man may be able to make the distinction, until one may have
proved to him that not alone their knowledge, but that some
sort of knowledge is possible? Assuredly, this is pushing
doubt very far. One could dispense with replying to this,
since the skeptic already interrogated concerning the difference
existing between what is and what is not has been
forced to admit it and to acquire thus some sort of knowledge
of being; but let us forget this, in order to examine why
the savants of Germany have inadequately removed a difficulty
which they have imposed upon themselves.</p>

<p>It is Kant, one of the ablest minds that Europe has produced
since the extinction of learning, who, resolved to
terminate with a single blow the struggle springing up
unceasingly between dogmatism and skepticism, has been
the first to form the bold project of creating a science which
should determine, <i>a priori</i>, the possibility, the principles,
and the limits of all
knowledge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_500" id="fnanchor_500"></a><a href="#footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></span>
This science, which he
named <cite>Critical Philosophy</cite>, or method of
judgment,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_501" id="fnanchor_501"></a><a href="#footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></span>
he
has developed in several works of considerable length and
very difficult of comprehension. I do not intend here to
make an explanation of this science; for this labour, out of
place in these Examinations, would carry me too far. My
intention is only to show the point wherein it has given way,
and how it has furnished new weapons for the skeptics,
in not holding well to the promise that it had made of determining
the principle of knowledge. Therefore, I will suppose
the doctrine of Kant understood or partially so. Several
works, circulated somewhat extensively in France, have
unravelled it sufficiently to the
savants.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_502" id="fnanchor_502"></a><a href="#footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></span>
I will only say
what the authors of these works have been unable to say,
and this will be the general result of the impression that the
study of this doctrine has made upon me: it is that Kant,
who pretends to found all his doctrine upon principles,
<i>a priori</i>, abstraction being made of all the underlying notions
of experience, and who, rising into an ideal sphere there to
consider reason in an absolute way, independent of its
effects so as to deduce from it a theory transcendental and
purely intelligible, concerning the principle of knowledge,
has done precisely the opposite from what he wished to do;
for not finding what he sought, he has found what he has
not sought, that is to say, the essence of matter. Let the
disciples of this philosophy give attention to what I say.
I have known several systems of philosophy and I have put
considerable force into penetrating them; but I can affirm
that there exists not a single one upon the face of the earth,
wherein the primitive matter of which the Universe is composed
may be characterized by traits as striking as in that
of Kant. I believe it impossible either to understand it
better or to depict it better. He uses neither figures, nor
symbols; he tells what he sees with a candour which would
have been appalling to Pythagoras and Plato; for what the
Koenigsberg professor advances concerning both the existence
and the non-existence of this
matter,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_503" id="fnanchor_503"></a><a href="#footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></span>
and of its intuitive
reality, and of its phenomenal illusion, and of its
essential forms, time and space, and of the labour that the
mind exercises upon this equivocal being, which, always
being engendered, never, however, exists; all this, taught in
the mysteries, was only clearly revealed to the initiate.
Listen a moment to what has transpired in India: it is the
fundamental axiom of the <i>Vedantic</i> school, the illustrious
disciples of Vyasa and of Sankarâchârya, an axiom in accordance
with the dogmas of the sacred books.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Matter exists [say these philosophers], but not of an existence
such as is imagined by the vulgar; it exists but it has no essence
independent of intellectual perceptions; for existence and perceptibility
are, in this case, convertible terms. The sage knows
that appearances and their exterior sensations are purely illusory
and that they would vanish into nothingness, if the Divine energy
which alone sustains them was for an instant
suspended.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_504" id="fnanchor_504"></a><a href="#footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>I beg the disciples of Kant to give attention to this
passage, and to remember what Plato has said of the same,
that, sometimes matter exists and sometimes it does not
exist<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_505" id="fnanchor_505"></a><a href="#footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></span>;
as Justin the martyr, and Cyril of Alexandria have
reproached him for it; and as Plutarch and Chalcidius
have strongly remarked
it,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_506" id="fnanchor_506"></a><a href="#footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></span>
in seeking to excuse this apparent
contradiction.</p>

<p>Let us endeavour now to call attention to the point
where Kant is led astray. This point, in the philosophical
course that this savant meant to pursue, seemed at first of
very slight importance; but the deviation that it causes,
although small and almost imperceptible at the first instant,
determines none the less a divergent line, which, turning
aside more and more from the right line proportionably as
it is prolonged, is found to strike at an enormous distance
from the mark where Kant hoped it would arrive. This
deviating point&mdash;&#8203;who would have believed it&mdash;&#8203;is found in
the misinterpretation and the misapplication of a word.
All the attention of the reader is required here. What I
am about to say, in demonstrating the error of the German
philosopher, will serve to supplement all that I have said
pertaining to the doctrine of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Kant, whether through imitation of the ancient philosophers
or through the effect of his own learning which had
made him desirous of knowing the truth, has considered
man under three principal modifications which he calls
faculties. In my twelfth Examination I have said that
such was the doctrine of Pythagoras. Plato, who followed
in everything the metaphysics of this great genius, distinguished
in Man as in the Universe, the body, soul, and spirit;
and placed, in each of the modifications of the particular or
universal unity which constituted them, the analogous
faculties which, becoming developed in their turn, gave
birth to three new modifications whose productive unity
they became<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_507" id="fnanchor_507"></a><a href="#footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></span>;
so that each ternary is represented in its
development, under the image of the triple Ternary, and
formed by its union with the Unity, first the Quaternary
and afterwards the
Decade.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_508" id="fnanchor_508"></a><a href="#footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></span>
Now the German philosopher,
without explaining the principle which led him to
consider man under three principal faculties, states them;
without saying to what particular modification he attributes
them, that is, without foreseeing if these faculties
are physical, animistic or intellectual; if they belong to
the body, to the soul, or to the mind: a first mistake which
leads him to a second of which I am about to speak.</p>

<p>In order to express these three facilities, Kant makes
use of three words taken from his own tongue and concerning
the meaning of which it is well to fix our attention. He
has named the first of these faculties <i>Empfindlichkeit</i>, the
second, <i>Verstand</i>, and the third, <i>Vernunft</i>. These three
words are excellent; it is only a question of clearly understanding
and explaining them.</p>

<p>The word <i>Empfindlichkeit</i> expresses that sort of faculty
which consists in collecting from without, feeling from within,
and finding good or
bad.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_509" id="fnanchor_509"></a><a href="#footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></span>
It has been very well rendered
in French by the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(sensibilité)</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>Verstand</i> designates that sort of faculty which
consists in reaching afar, being carried from a central point
to all other points of the circumference to seize
them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_510" id="fnanchor_510"></a><a href="#footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></span>

It has been quite well rendered in French by the word
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(entendement)</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>Vernunft</i> is applied to that sort of faculty,
which consists in choosing at a distance, in wishing, in
selecting, in electing that which is
good.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_511" id="fnanchor_511"></a><a href="#footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></span>
It is expressed
by the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(raison)</i>; but this expresses it very poorly, whatever
may be the real meaning given it by Kant.</p>

<p>This philosopher ought to have realized more fully the
origin of this word and he should have made a more just
application; then his system would have taken another
direction and he would have attained his goal. He would
have made us see, and he would have seen himself, the reality,
namely, <em>intelligence</em> and not reason.</p>

<p>One can easily see that the faculty which Kant designates
by the word <i>Empfindlichkeit</i>, sense perception, belongs to
the physical part of man; and that which he expresses by
the word <i>Verstand</i>, the understanding, resides in his animistic
part; but one cannot see at all that what he names <i>Vernunft</i>,
and which he continually confounds with reason, may be able
in any manner to dominate in his intellectual part. For
this, it would be necessary that he should consider it under
the relation of the intelligence; which he has not done. It
is very true that he has wished to place it constantly in the
mind, by representing the three faculties of which man is
composed as a sort of hierarchy, of which sense perception
occupies the base, understanding the centre, and reason the
summit; or as one of his translators said, imagining this
hierarchy under the emblem of an empire, of which sense
perception constitutes the subjects, understanding the
agents or ministers, and reason the sovereign or
legislator.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_512" id="fnanchor_512"></a><a href="#footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></span>

I cannot conceive how Kant, by giving the word <i>Vernunft</i>,
the meaning of the Latin word <i>ratio</i>, has been able to say
that it is the highest degree of the activity of a mind which
has the power of all its liberty, and the consciousness of all
its strength<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_513" id="fnanchor_513"></a><a href="#footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></span>:
there is nothing more false. Reason does
not exist in liberty, but on the contrary, in necessity. Its
movement, which is geometric, is always forced: it is an
inference from the point of departure, and nothing more.
Let us examine this carefully. The Latin word <i>ratio</i>, whose
meaning Kant has visibly followed, has never translated
exactly the Greek word <i>logos</i>, in the sense of <i>word</i>; and
if the Greek philosophers have substituted sometimes the
<i>logos</i> for <i>nous</i>, or the word for the intelligence, by taking
the effect for the cause, it is wrong when the Romans have
tried to imitate them, by using <i>ratio</i>, in place of <i>mens</i>, or
<i>intelligentia</i>. In this they have proved their ignorance and
have disclosed the calamitous ravages that skepticism had
already made among them. The word <i>ratio</i> springs from
the root <i>ra</i> or <i>rat</i>, which in all the tongues where it has been
received, has carried the idea of a <i>ray</i>, a straight line drawn
from one point to
another.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_514" id="fnanchor_514"></a><a href="#footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></span>
Thus reason, far from being
free as Kant has pretended, is what is the most constrained
in nature: it is a geometric line, always subject to
the point whence it emanates, and forced to strike the point
toward which it is directed under penalty of ceasing to be
itself; that is to say, of ceasing to be straight. Now, reason
not being free in its course, is neither good nor bad in itself;
it is always analogous to the principle of which it is the
inference. Its nature is to go straight; its perfection is
nothing else. One goes straight in every way, in every
direction, high, low, to right, to left; one reasons correctly
in truth as in error, in vice as in virtue: all depends upon
the principle from which one sets out, and upon the manner
in which one looks at things. Reason does not give this
principle; it is no more master of the end which it goes to
attain, than the straight line drawn upon the ground is
master of the point toward which it tends. This end and
this point are determined beforehand, by the position of the
reasoner or by geometry.</p>

<p>Reason exists alike in the three great human modifications,
although its principal seat is in the soul, according to
Plato.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_515" id="fnanchor_515"></a><a href="#footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></span>
There is a physical reason acting in the instinct, a moral
reason acting in the soul, and an intellectual reason acting
in the mind. When a hungry dog brings to his master a
piece of game without touching it, he obeys an instinctive
reason which makes him sacrifice the pleasure of gratifying
his appetite, to the pain of receiving the blow of a stick.
When a man dies at his post instead of abandoning it, he
follows a moral reason which makes him prefer the glory of
dying to the shame of living. When a philosopher admits
the immortality of the soul, he listens to an intellectual
reason which shows him the impossibility of its annihilation.
All this, nevertheless, takes place only so far as the dog, the
man, and the philosopher admit the real principles; for if
they admitted false principles, their reasons, although
equally well deduced, would conduct them to opposed results;
and the piece of game would be eaten, the post
would be abandoned, and the immortality of the soul
would be denied.</p>

<p>One ought to feel now the mistake of Kant in all its
extent. This philosopher having confounded one of the
principal modifications of man, his
intelligence,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_516" id="fnanchor_516"></a><a href="#footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></span>
whose
seat is in the soul, with one of his secondary faculties, his
reason, finds himself, in raising this reason outside of its
place and giving it a dominance that it has not, ousting
entirely the spiritual part; so that meditating constantly
in the median part of his being, which he believed to be the
superior, and descending, he found matter, understood it
perfectly, and missed absolutely the spirit. What he assumed
was, it was nothing else than the understanding, a
neuter faculty placed between sense perception which is
purely passive, and the intelligence which is wholly active.
He had the weakness to fix his thought here and thenceforth
was lost. Reason which he invoked to teach him to distinguish,
in his ideas, the part which is furnished by the spirit,
from that which is given by objects, was only able to show
him the straight line that it described in his understanding.
This line being buried in matter instead of rising in intelligible
regions, taught him that everything that did not
correspond to a possible experience could not furnish him
the subject of a positive knowledge, and thus all the great
questions upon the existence of God, the immortality of the
soul, the origin of the Universe; all that pertains to theosophy,
to cosmology; in short, all that which is intelligible, cannot
take place in the order of his
understanding.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_517" id="fnanchor_517"></a><a href="#footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></span>
This
catastrophe, quite inevitable as it was, was none the less
poignant. It was odd to see a man who seemed to promise
to establish the possibility and the principles of all knowledge
upon an incontestable basis, announce coldly that
God, the Universe, and the Soul could not be subjects there,
and soon discover, pushed by the force of his reasoning,
that even the reality of physical subjects by which the
senses are affected is only phenomenal, that one can in no
way know what they are, but only what they appear to
be<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_518" id="fnanchor_518"></a><a href="#footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>;
and that even one’s own Self, considered as a subject,
is also for one only a phenomenon, an appearance, concerning
the intimate essence of which one can learn
nothing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_519" id="fnanchor_519"></a><a href="#footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></span>
Kant felt indeed the terrible contradiction into which he had
fallen; but instead of retracing courageously his steps, and
seeking above reason for the principles of knowledge that it
did not possess, he continued his descending movement which
he called transcendental, and finally discovered beneath
this <em>pure Reason</em>, a certain <em>practical Reason</em>, to which he confided
the destinies of the greatest subjects with which man
can be occupied: God, nature, and himself. This practical
reason, which is no other than <em>common sense</em>, ought, according
to him, to bring man to believe what is not given him
to know,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_520" id="fnanchor_520"></a><a href="#footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></span>
and to engage him, through the need of his own
felicity, to follow the paths of virtue, and to admit the
system of recompense which proceeds from the existence of
God and the immortality of the soul. Thus, this common
sense, already invoked to aid the existence of the physical
subjects which Berkeley reduced to nothingness, was called,
under another name, to sustain that of the spiritual beings
which Kant admitted baffling the action of his pure reason;
but this faculty, vainly proposed by
Shaftesbury,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_521" id="fnanchor_521"></a><a href="#footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></span>
by
Hutcheson,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_522" id="fnanchor_522"></a><a href="#footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></span>
by Reid,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_523" id="fnanchor_523"></a><a href="#footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></span>
by Oswald,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_524" id="fnanchor_524"></a><a href="#footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></span>
by the celebrated
Pascal himself,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_525" id="fnanchor_525"></a><a href="#footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></span>
to give a support to the first truths, and
to furnish the principles of our moral and physical knowledge;
this faculty, I say, whose seat is in the instinct, has
been easily challenged as incompetent to pronounce upon the
subjects which are outside the jurisdiction of its judgments;
for it has been keenly felt that it was abandoning these
subjects to the prejudices of the vulgar, to their erroneous
opinions, to their blind passions; and that practical philosophy
or common sense, acting in each man according to
the extent of his views, would only embarrass relative truths
and would create as many principles as individuals. Furthermore
was it not to run counter to common sense itself,
to submit intelligence and reason to it? Was it not subverting
Nature, and, as it were, causing light to spring upward
from below, seeking in the particular, the law which
rules the Universal?</p>

<p>The skeptics who saw all these things triumphed, but
their triumph only proved their weakness; for Reason, by
which they demonstrated nothingness, is the sole weapon of
which they can make use. This faculty overthrown in
Kant, leaves them powerless, and delivers them defenceless
to the irresistible axioms that the intelligence places <i>a priori</i>
upon the primordial truths and the fundamental principles
of the Universe, even as the sequel of these Examinations
will demonstrate.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">24. <i>Meditate upon my counsels, love them; follow them:<br />
            &ensp;To the divine virtues will they know how to lead thee.</i></p>

<p>I have spoken at considerable length of the skeptics;
but I have believed it necessary in explaining a dogmatic
work, whose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(esprit)</i> is wholly opposed to that of skepticism.
When Lysis wrote in Greece, there had been no one as yet
who doubted either the existence of the gods, or that of
the Universe, or made the distinction between good and
evil, virtue and vice. Arcesilaus and Pyrrho were not born,
and the clouds that they raised afterwards concerning these
great subjects of the meditation of the sages were not even
suspected. The minds had inclined rather toward credulity
than toward doubt; toward superstition than toward
atheism; it was more necessary to limit their curiosity than
to excite their indifference. At that epoch, the philosophers
enveloped the truth with veils, and rendered the avenues of
science difficult, so that the vulgar might not profane them.
They knew what had been too long forgotten: that all kinds
of wood are not fitting to make a Mercury. Also their
writers were obscure and sententious: in order to dishearten,
not those who might be able to doubt, but those who were
not in a condition to comprehend.</p>

<p>Today, as the minds are changed, it is of more importance
to attract those who are able to receive the truth, than
to keep at a distance those who are unable to receive it;
the latter, separating themselves, are persuaded that they
either possess it or have no need of it. I have given the
history of skepticism; I have shown its origin and the sorry
effects of its absolute and disordered influence; not in order
to bring back the skeptics of the profession, but to endeavour
to prevent the men who are still drifting in uncertainty from
becoming so. I have essayed to show them by the example
of one of the greatest reasoners of Germany, by the example
of Kant, that reason alone, with whatever talents it may
be accompanied, cannot fail to lead them to nothingness.
I have made them see that this faculty so lauded is nothing
of itself. I am content with the example of the Koenigsberg
professor; but had I not feared prolixities, I would have
added the example of Berkeley and that of Spinoza. The
varied catastrophes of these three savants form a striking
contrast. Kant, following step by step his pure Reason,
comes to see that the knowledge of intelligible things is impossible
and finds matter; Berkeley, led by the same reason,
proves that the existence of matter is illusory, and that all is
spirit; Spinoza, drawing irresistible arguments from this same
faculty, shows that there exists and can exist only one sole
substance and that therefore spirit and matter are but one.
And do not think that, armed with reason alone, you can
combat separately Spinoza, Berkeley, or Kant: their contradictory
systems will clash in vain; they will triumph
over you and will push you into the dark and bottomless
abyss of skepticism.</p>

<p>Now, how can this be done? I have told you: it is because
man is not a simple being. Fix this truth firmly.
Man is triple; and it is according as his volitive unity operates
in one or the other of his modifications that he is led
on to see, in such or such a way. Plato has said it, following
Pythagoras, and I say it to you not only following Pythagoras
and Plato, but following all the sages and all the
theosophists of the world. Plato places in the superior
and spiritual modification, composed of the <em>same</em>, that is
to say of the indivisible substance of the universe, the
<i>hegemonicon</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_526" id="fnanchor_526"></a><a href="#footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></span>
or the intellectual assent; in the inferior and
material modification, composed of the <em>other</em> or the <em>diverse</em>,
that is to say, of the divisible substance, the
<i>physicon</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_527" id="fnanchor_527"></a><a href="#footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></span>
or the physical sense perception; in the median modification
or the soul, properly speaking, composed of essence, that
is to say, of the most subtle parts of matter elaborated by
the spirit, the
<i>logicon</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_528" id="fnanchor_528"></a><a href="#footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></span>
or the moral, logical, or reasonable
sentiment. One finds in Plutarch the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(résumé)</i> of the doctrine
of a philosopher named Sylla, who, admitting, as did Plato,
that man is composed of spirit, soul, and body, said that the
body drew its origin from the earth, the soul from the moon,
and the spirit from the
sun.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_529" id="fnanchor_529"></a><a href="#footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></span>
But without disturbing
ourselves for the present, with the origin of these three
parts, since assuredly the earth, the moon, and the sun,
which this philosopher has assigned them for principles,
are things very difficult to understand in themselves, let us
be content with knowing, as I have already said, that these
three great modifications which form the human Quaternary
manifest themselves by sensation, sentiment, and assent,
and develop the principal faculties of the instinct, the understanding,
and the intelligence. The instinct is the seat
of common sense; the understanding is that of reason;
and the intelligence, that of sagacity or wisdom. Men
can never acquire any science, any real knowledge, if the
assent is not determined by favour of the intelligence
which elects the principle and places it with sagacity; for
one can really know or understand only that to which the
intelligence has given consent. All the results that the
understanding, deprived of intelligence, can procure by
means of reason are only opinions, those of these results
which are rigorously demonstrated in the manner of the
geometricians are identities; common sense transported
even into the understanding can give only notions, the
certainty of which, however founded it may be upon experience,
can never surpass that of physical sensation, whose
transient and limited authority is of no weight in the assent
of intelligible truths.</p>

<p>Let us venture now to divulge a secret of the mysteries
to which Pythagoras made allusion when he said: that not
all kinds of wood are fitting to make a Mercury; and notwithstanding
the vulgar prejudice which is opposed to
this truth, let us affirm that animistic equality among men
is a chimera. I feel that here I am about to clash greatly
with theological ideas and to put myself in opposition to
many brilliant paradoxes that modern philosophers, more
virtuous than wise, have raised and sustained with more
talent and reason than sagacity; but the force of my subject
draws me on and since I am explaining the doctrine of
Pythagoras, it is indeed necessary that I should say why
Lysis, after having examined and commended in detail all
the human virtues in the purgative part of his teachings,
begins again a new instruction in the unitive part and promises
to lead one to divine virtues. This important distinction
that he makes between these two kinds of virtues has
been made by Plato, Aristotle, Galen, and many others of
the philosophers of
antiquity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_530" id="fnanchor_530"></a><a href="#footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></span>
One of them, Macrobius,
to whom we owe the knowledge and explanation of many
of the mystic secrets, which, notwithstanding the extreme
care exercised to conceal them, were rumoured outside of
the sanctuaries, has made a comparison between the degrees
of the initiation and those that one admits in the exercise
of the virtues; and he enumerates
four.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_531" id="fnanchor_531"></a><a href="#footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></span>
This number,
which is related to the universal Quaternary, has been the
most constantly followed, although it may have varied,
however, from three to seven. The number <em>three</em> was
regarded by the ancients as the principle of nature, and the
number <em>seven</em> as its
end.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_532" id="fnanchor_532"></a><a href="#footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></span>
The principal degrees of initiation
were, to the number of three, as the grades of the
apprentice, companion, and master are in Free Masonry
today. From this comes the epithet of Triple, given to
the mysterious Hecate, and even to Mithra, considered
as the emblem of mystic
knowledge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_533" id="fnanchor_533"></a><a href="#footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></span>
Sometimes three
secondary degrees were added to the three principal ones
and were terminated by an extraordinary revelation, which
raising the initiate to the rank of <i>Epopt</i>, or seer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(par excellence)</i>,
gave him the true signification of the degrees through which
he had already
passed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_534" id="fnanchor_534"></a><a href="#footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></span>;
showed him nature
unveiled,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_535" id="fnanchor_535"></a><a href="#footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></span>
and admitted him to the contemplation of divine
knowledge.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_536" id="fnanchor_536"></a><a href="#footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></span>

It was for the Epopt alone that the last veil fell,
and the sacred vestment which covered the statue of the
Goddess was removed. This manifestation, called Epiphany,
shed the most brilliant light upon the darkness which
until then had surrounded the initiate. It was prepared,
said the historians, by frightful tableaux with alternatives
of both terror and
hope.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_537" id="fnanchor_537"></a><a href="#footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></span>
The grade of Elect has replaced
that of Epopt among the Free Masons, without in any sense
offering the same results. The forms are indeed nearly
preserved; but the substance has disappeared. The Epopt
of Eleusis, Samothrace, or Hierapolis was regarded as the
foremost of men, the favourite of the gods, and the possessor
of celestial treasures; the sun shone, in his sight, with a
purer brightness; and the sublime virtue that he had acquired
in the tests, more and more difficult, and the lessons
more and more lofty, gave him the faculty of discerning
good and evil, truth and error, and of making a free choice
between them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_538" id="fnanchor_538"></a><a href="#footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the various grades of initiation expressed symbolically
the different degrees of virtue to which men in general
can attain, the tests that one was made to pass through at
each new grade, made known in particular, whether the
man who presented himself to obtain it, was worthy or
unworthy. These tests were at first sufficiently easy; but
they became increasingly difficult to such an extent that
the life of the new member was frequently in danger. One
would know in that way to what sort of man this life belonged,
and verify by the crucible of terror and of suffering,
the temper of the soul and the claim of his right to the truth.
It is known that Pythagoras owed to his extreme patience
and to the courage with which he surmounted all the
obstacles, his initiation into the Egyptian
mysteries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_539" id="fnanchor_539"></a><a href="#footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></span>
Those who attained as he did the last degree of initiation
were very rare; the greater number went no further than
the second grade and very few attained the third. Lessons
proportionate to their strength and to those of the faculties
that had been recognized as dominating in them were
given; for this is the essential point in this Examination, one
learned in the sanctuaries to divide the mass of humanity
into three great classes, dominated by a fourth more elevated,
according to the relations that were established between
the faculties of men and the parts of the Universe to which
they corresponded. In the first were ranged the material
or instinctive men; in the second, the animistic, and in the
third, the intellectual men. Thus all men were by no means
considered as equal among them. The pretended equality
which was made on the exterior was mere compliance to the
errors of the vulgar, who, having seized the authority in
most of the cities of Greece and Italy, forced the truth to
conceal an exposure which would have injured it. The
Christian cult, raised upon the extinction of all enlightenment,
nourished in the hearts of slaves and lowly citizens,
sanctified in the course of time a precedent favourable to
its growth. Those, however, among the Christians who
were called gnostics,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_540" id="fnanchor_540"></a><a href="#footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></span>
on account of the particular knowledge
that they possessed, and especially the Valentinians
who boasted that they had preserved the knowledge of the
initiation, wished to make a public dogma of the secret of
the mysteries in this respect, pretending that the corruption
of men being only the effect of their ignorance and of their
earthly attachment, it was only necessary in order to save
them, to enlighten them regarding their condition and their
original destination<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_541" id="fnanchor_541"></a><a href="#footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></span>;
but the orthodox ones, who felt
the danger into which this doctrine was drawing them,
condemned the authors as heretics.</p>

<p>This condemnation, which satisfied the pride of the
vulgar, did not prevent the small number of sages remaining
silent, faithful to the truth. It is only necessary to open
one’s eyes, and detaching them a moment from Judea, to
see that the dogma of inequality among men had served as
basis for the civil and religious laws of all the peoples of the
earth, from the orient of Asia to the occidental limits of
Africa and Europe. Everywhere, four great established
divisions under the name of Castes, recalled the four principal
degrees of initiation and retraced upon humanity
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(en masse)</i>, the Universal Quaternary. Egypt had, in this
respect, in very ancient times, given example to
Greece<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_542" id="fnanchor_542"></a><a href="#footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></span>;
for this Greece, so proud of her liberty, or rather of her turbulent
anarchy, had been at first subjected to the common
division, even as it is seen in Aristotle and
Strabo.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_543" id="fnanchor_543"></a><a href="#footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></span>
The
Chaldeans were, relative to the peoples of
Assyria,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_544" id="fnanchor_544"></a><a href="#footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></span>
only
what the Magi were among the
Persians,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_545" id="fnanchor_545"></a><a href="#footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></span>
the Druids
among the Gauls,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_546" id="fnanchor_546"></a><a href="#footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></span>
and the Brahmans among the Indians.
It is quite well known that this last people, the Brahmans,
constitute the foremost and highest of the four castes of
which the whole nation is composed. The allegorical origin
that religion gives to these castes proves clearly the analogy
of which I have spoken. The following is what is found
relative to this in one of the Shastras. “At the first creation
by Brahma, the Brahmans sprang from his mouth;
the Kshatrys issued from his arms; the Vaisyas from his
thighs, and the Soudras from his feet.” It is said in another
of these books containing the cosmogony of the Banians,
that the first man, called Pourou, having had four sons
named Brahma, Kshetri, Vaisa, and Souderi, God designated
them to be chiefs of the four tribes which he himself
instituted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_547" id="fnanchor_547"></a><a href="#footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></span>
The sacred books of the Burmans, which appear
anterior to those of the other Indian nations, establish the
same division. The Rahans, who fill the sacerdotal offices
among these peoples, teach a doctrine conformable to that
of the mysteries. They say that inequality among men is
a necessary consequence of their past virtues or past vices,
and that they are born in a nation more or less enlightened,
in a caste, in a family, more or less illustrious, according to
their previous conduct.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_548" id="fnanchor_548"></a><a href="#footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></span>
This is very close to the thought
of Pythagoras; but no one has expressed it with greater
force and clearness than Kong-Tse. I think I have no need
to say that these two sages did not copy each other. The
assent that they gave to the same idea had its source elsewhere
than in sterile imitation.</p>

<p>The Chinese people, from time immemorial, have been
divided into four great classes, relative to the rank that men
occupy in society, following the functions that they execute
therein,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_549" id="fnanchor_549"></a><a href="#footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></span>
very nearly as do the Indians: but this division,
that long custom has rendered purely political, is looked upon
very differently by the philosophers. Man, according to
them, constitutes one of the three productive powers which
compose the median trinity of the Universe; for they consider
the Universe, or the great All, as the expression of a
triple Trinity enveloped and dominated by the primordial
Unity: which constitutes for them a decade instead of a
Quaternary. This third power called <i>Yin</i>, that is to say,
mankind, is subdivided into three principal classes, which
by means of the intermediary classes admitted by Kong-Tse,
produces the five classes spoken of by this sage.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The first class, the most numerous, comprises [he said] that
multitude of men who act only by a sort of imitative <em>instinct</em>,
doing today what they did yesterday, in order to recommence tomorrow
what they have done today; and who, incapable of discerning
in the distance the real and substantial advantages, the
interest of highest importance, extract easily a little profit,
a base interest in the pettiest things, and have enough adroitness
to procure them. These men have an <em>understanding</em> as the others
but this understanding goes no further than the <em>senses</em>; they see
and hear only through the eyes and the ears of their bodies.
Such are the people.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The second class is composed [according to the same sage]
of men instructed in the sciences, in letters and in the liberal arts.
These men have an object in view in whatever they undertake,
and know the different means by which the end can be accomplished;
they have not penetrated into the essence of things, but
they know them well enough to speak of them with ease and to
give lessons to others; whether they speak or whether they act,
they can give <em>reason</em> for what they say or what they do, comparing
subjects among them and drawing just inferences concerning
what is harmful or profitable: these are the artists, the <i>literati</i>,
who are occupied with things wherein <em>reasoning</em> must enter.
This class can have an influence on customs and even on the
government.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The third class [continues Kong-Tse] comprises those who
in their speech, in their actions, and in the whole of their conduct,
never deviate from what is prescribed by <em>right reason</em>; who do
good without any pretension whatsoever; but only because it is
good; who never vary, and show themselves the same in adversity
as in fortune. These men speak when it is necessary to speak, and
are silent when it is necessary to be silent. They are not satisfied
with drawing the sciences from the diverse channels destined
to transmit them, but go back to the source. These are the
philosophers.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Those who never digress from the fixed and immutable rule
which they have traced out for themselves, who, with utmost
exactness and a constancy always the same, fulfill to the very
least, their obligations, who fight their passions, observe themselves
unceasingly, and prevent vices from developing; those
finally, who speak no word which is not measured and that may
not be useful for instruction, and who fear neither trouble nor
labour in order to make <em>virtue</em> prosper in themselves and in others,
constitute the fourth class, which is that of virtuous men.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The fifth class, finally [adds Kong-Tse], which is the loftiest
and sublimest, comprises the extraordinary men, who unite in
their persons the qualities of the spirit and heart, perfected by the
blessed habit of fulfilling voluntarily and joyfully, what nature
and morals impose jointly upon reasonable beings living in
society. Imperturbable in their mode of life, like unto the sun
and the moon, the heavens and the earth, they never cease their
beneficent operations; they act by <em>intelligence</em> and as <em>spirits</em> see
without being seen. This class, very few in number, can be called
that of the Perfect ones, the
Saints.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_550" id="fnanchor_550"></a><a href="#footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>I have transcribed what has just been read without
changing a single word. If the reader has given to this
extract the attention that it merits, he will have seen the
doctrine of Pythagoras such as I have revealed and the
important distinction between Instinct, Reason, and Intelligence
such as I have established; he will have seen the
dogma of the mysteries concerning the animistic inequality
of men, of which I have spoken, and will have easily recognized,
in the right reason which constitutes the third class
according to the Chinese theosophist, the pure reason which
has directed the German philosopher in the establishment
of critical philosophy. This right reason, being quite near
to human virtues, is still very far from Wisdom which alone
leads to Truth. Nevertheless it can reach there, for nothing
is impossible for the Will of man, even as I have quite forcibly
stated<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_551" id="fnanchor_551"></a><a href="#footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></span>;
but it would be necessary for that, to make
acquisition of the divine virtues, and in the same manner
that one is raised from instinct to understanding by purification,
to pass from understanding to intelligence by perfection.
Lysis offers the means: it is by knowledge of
oneself that he promises to lead one to this desired end;
he assures it, he invokes the name of Pythagoras himself:</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">25. <i>I swear it by the one who in our hearts engraved<br />
           &ensp;The sacred Tetrad, symbol immense and pure,<br />
           &ensp;Source of Nature and model of the Gods.</i></p>

<p>Drawn on by my subject, I have forgotten to say that,
according to Porphyry, there is lacking in the Golden Verses
as given by Hierocles, two lines which ought to be placed
immediately before those which open the unitive part of
the doctrine of Pythagoras called <em>perfection</em>; these
are<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_552" id="fnanchor_552"></a><a href="#footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></span>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Πρῶτα μὲν ἐξ ὕπνοιο μελίφρονος ἐξ ὑπανίτας,</div>
<div class="i0">Εὖ μάλα ποιπνεύειν ὅσ’ ἐν ἤματι ἔργα τελέσσεις.</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">On the moment of awakening, consider calmly</div>
<div class="i0">What are thy duties, and what thou shouldst accomplish.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>These lines, which express the general outline of this last
part, are remarkable, and one cannot conceive how Hierocles
could have overlooked or neglected them. Although,
it is true, they add nothing in the literal sense, they say
much, however, in the figurative sense; they serve as proof
of the division of this poem, which Hierocles himself has
adopted without explanation. Lysis indicates quite strongly
that he is about to pass on to a new teaching: he calls the
attention of the disciple of Pythagoras to the new career
which is opened before him, and to the means of traversing
it and of attaining to the divine virtues which must crown
it. This means is the knowledge of oneself, as I have said.
This knowledge, so commended by the ancient sages, so
exalted by them, which must open the avenues of all the
others and deliver to them the key of the mysteries of nature
and the doors of the Universe; this knowledge, I say, could
not be exposed unveiled at the epoch when Pythagoras
lived, on account of the secrets that it would of necessity
betray. Likewise this philosopher had the habit of proclaiming
it under the emblem of the sacred Tetrad or of the
Quaternary. This is why Lysis, in invoking the name of
his master, designates it on this occasion with the most
striking characteristic of his doctrine. “I swear,” he said,
“by the one who has revealed to our soul the knowledge of
the Tetrad, that source of eternal Nature”: that is to say,
I swear by the one who, teaching our soul to know itself,
has put it in condition to know all nature of which it is the
abridged image.</p>

<p>In many of my preceding Examinations I have already
explained what should be understood by this celebrated
Tetrad, and here would perhaps be the time to reveal its
constitutive principles; but this revelation would lead me
too far. It would be necessary in order to do this, to enter
into details of the arithmological doctrine of Pythagoras
which, lacking preliminary data, would become fatiguing
and unintelligible. The language of Numbers of which
this philosopher made use, following the example of the
ancient sages, seems today entirely lost. The fragments
which have come down to us serve rather to prove its existence
than to give any light upon its elements; for those
who have composed these fragments wrote in a language
that they supposed understood, in the same manner as our
modern writers when they employ algebraic terms. It would
be ridiculous if one wished before having acquired any
notion concerning the value and use of the algebraic signs,
to explain a problem contained in these signs. This is,
however, what has often been done relative to the language
of Numbers. One has pretended, not only to explain it
before having learned it, but even to write of it, and has
by so doing rendered it the most lamentable thing in the
world. The savants seeing it thus travestied have justly
scorned it; as their contempt was not unreasonable they
have made it reflect, by the same language upon the ancients
who have employed it. They have acted in this as in many
other things; they themselves creating the stupidity of
ancient sciences and saying afterwards: antiquity was stupid.</p>

<p>One day I shall try, if I find the time and the necessary
facilities, to give the true elements of the arithmological
science of Pythagoras and I will show that this science was
for intelligible things what algebra has become among us
for physical things; but I shall only do so after having revealed
what the true principles of music are; for otherwise
I should run the risk of not being understood.</p>

<p>Without perplexing ourselves, therefore, with the constitutive
principles of the Pythagorean Quaternary, let us
content ourselves with knowing that it was the general
emblem of anything moving by itself and manifesting by its
facultative modifications; for according to Pythagoras, 1
and 2 represent the hidden principles of things; 3, their
faculties, and 4, their proper essence. These four numbers
which, united by addition produce the number 10, constituted
the Being, as much universal as particular; so that
the Quaternary, which is as its virtue, could become the
emblem of all beings, since there is none which may not
recognize the principles, and which does not manifest itself
by faculties more or less perfect, and which may not enjoy
an existence universal or relative; but the being to which
Pythagoras applied it most commonly was Man. Man, as
I have said, manifests himself as does the Universe, under
the three principal modifications of body, soul, and spirit.
The unknown principles of this first Ternary are what Plato
calls the <em>same</em>, and the <em>other</em>, the <em>indivisible</em> and the <em>divisible</em>.
The indivisible principle gives the spirit; the divisible the
body; and the soul has birth from this last principle elaborated
by the first.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_553" id="fnanchor_553"></a><a href="#footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></span>
Such was the doctrine of Pythagoras
which was borrowed by Plato. It had been that of the
Egyptians, as can be seen in the works which remain to us
under the name of Hermes. Synesius, who had been initiated
into their mysteries, said particularly, that human
souls emanated from two sources: the one luminous, which
flows from heaven on high; the other tenebrous, which
springs from the earth in the abysmal depths of which it
finds its origin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_554" id="fnanchor_554"></a><a href="#footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></span>
The early Christians, faithful to theosophical
tradition, followed the same teaching; they established
a great difference between the spirit and the soul.
They considered the soul as an issue of the material principle,
and in consequence being neither enlightened nor
virtuous in itself. The spirit, said Basil, is a gift of God:
it is the soul of the soul, as it were; it is united to the soul;
it enlightens it, it rescues it from earth and raises it to
heaven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_555" id="fnanchor_555"></a><a href="#footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></span>
Beausobre, who relates these words, observes
that this sentiment was common to several Fathers of the
primitive church, particularly to
Tatian.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_556" id="fnanchor_556"></a><a href="#footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>I have spoken often of this first Ternary, and even of
the triple faculties which are attached to each of its modifications;
but as I have done many times, I believe it useful
to present here the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(ensemble)</i>, so as to have the opportunity
of uniting, under the same viewpoint, the volitive unity,
from which results the human Quaternary, in general, and
in the particular being, which is man.</p>

<p>The three faculties which, as I have said, distinguish
each of the three human modifications are: sense perception
for the body, sentiment for the soul, and assent for the spirit.
These three faculties develop instinct, understanding, and
intelligence, which produce by a common reaction, common
sense, reason, and sagacity.</p>

<p>Instinct, placed at the lowest degree of the ontological
hierarchy, is absolutely passive; intelligence, raised to the
summit, is entirely active, and understanding placed in
the centre, is neuter. Sense perception perceives the sensations,
sentiment conceives the ideas, assent elects the
thoughts; perception, conception, election are modes of
acting, of the instinct, the understanding, and the intelligence.
The understanding is the seat of all the passions
that the instinct feeds continually, excites, and tends to
make unruly; and that the intelligence purifies, tempers,
and seeks always to put in harmony. The instinct, reacted
upon by the understanding, becomes common sense: it
perceives notions more or less clearly, following more or
less, the influence that it accords to the understanding.
The understanding, reacted upon by the intelligence, becomes
reason: it conceives of opinions so much the more
just, as its passions are the more calm. Reason cannot by
its own movement attain to wisdom and find truth, because
being placed in the middle of a sphere and forced from there,
it describes, from the centre to the circumference, a ray always
straight and subordinate to the point of departure; it has
against it infinity, that is to say, that truth being one, and
residing in a single point of the circumference, it cannot be
the subject of reason, only as far as it is known beforehand,
and as reason is placed in the direction convenient for its
encounter. Intelligence, which can only put reason in
this direction by the assent that it gives at the point of
departure, would never know this point only by wisdom
which is the fruit of inspiration: now, inspiration is the
mode of acting of the will, which joining itself to the triple
Ternary, as I have just described, constitutes the human
ontological Quaternary. It is the will which envelops the
primordial Ternary in its unity, and which determines the
action of each of its faculties according to its own mode
without the will it would have no existence. The three
faculties by which the volitive unity is manifested in the
triple Ternary, are memory, judgment, and imagination.
These three faculties, acting in a homogeneous unity, have
neither height nor depth and do not affect one of the modifications
of the being, any more than another; they are all
wherever the will is, and the will operates freely in the intelligence
or in the understanding; in the understanding or in
the instinct: where it wills to be there it is; its faculties
follow it everywhere. I say that it is wherever it wills to
be when the being is wholly developed; for following the
course of Nature, it is first in the instinct and only passes
into the understanding and into the intelligence successively
and in proportion as the animistic and spiritual faculties
are developed. But in order that this development may
take place, the will must determine it; for without the will
there is no movement. Be assured of this. Without the
operation of the will, the soul is inert and the spirit sterile.
This is the origin of that inequality among men of which
I have spoken. When the will does not disengage itself
from matter, it constitutes instinctive men; when it is concentrated
in the understanding, it produces animistic men;
when it acts in the spirit, it creates intellectual men. Its
perfect harmony in the primordial Ternary, and its action
more or less energetic in the uniformity of their faculties,
equally developed, constitute the extraordinary men endowed
with sublime genius; but the men of this fourth class
which represents the autopsy of the
mysteries,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_557" id="fnanchor_557"></a><a href="#footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></span>
are extremely
rare. Often it suffices for a powerful will, acting either
in the understanding or in the intelligence and concentrating
wholly there, to astonish men by the strength of reasoning
and outbursts of wisdom, which draws the name of genius
without being wholly merited. Recently there has been
seen in Germany the most extraordinary reasoning, in
Kant, failing in its aim through lack of intelligence; one has
seen in the same country the most exalted intelligence, in
Boehme, giving way for want of reason. There have been in
all times and among all nations men similar to Boehme and
to Kant. These men have erred through not knowing
themselves; they have erred, through a lack of harmony
that they might have been able to acquire, if they had
taken the time to perfect themselves; they have erred, but
their very error attests the force of their will. A weak will,
operating either in the understanding or in the intelligence,
makes only sensible men and men of intellect. This same
will acting in the instinct produces artful men; and if it is
strong and violently concentrated through its original attraction
in this corporal faculty, it constitutes men dangerous
to society, miscreants, and treacherous brigands.</p>

<p>After having applied the Pythagorean Quaternary to
Man, and having shown the intimate composition of this
Being, image of the Universe, according to the doctrine of
the ancients, I ought perhaps to use all the means in my
power, in order to demonstrate with what facility the physical
and metaphysical phenomena which result from their
combined action can be deduced; but such an undertaking
would necessarily draw me into details foreign to these
examinations. I must again put off this point as I have put
off many others; I will take them up in another work, if the
savants and the thinkers to whom I address myself approve
the motive which has put the pen in my hand.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">26. <i>But before all, thy soul to its faithful duty,<br />
            &ensp;Invoke these Gods with fervour, they whose aid,<br />
            &ensp;Thy work begun, alone can terminate.</i></p>

<p>All the cults established upon the face of the earth have
made a religious duty of prayer. This alone would prove,
if it were necessary, what I have advanced concerning the
theosophical dogma of the volitive liberty of man; for if man
were not free in his actions, and if an irresistible fatality
led him on to misfortune and to crime, what use would be
invoking the gods, imploring their assistance, begging them
to turn aside from him the evils which must inevitably
overwhelm him? If, as Epicurus taught, an impenetrable
barrier separated gods and men; if these gods, absorbed in
their beatitude and their impassive immortality, were such
strangers to the evils of humanity that they neither troubled
to alleviate them nor to prevent them, for what purpose
then the incense burning at the foot of their
altars?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_558" id="fnanchor_558"></a><a href="#footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, he said, on account of the excellence of their
nature that he honoured them thus, and not from any
motive of hope or fear, not expecting any good from them
and not dreading any
evil.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_559" id="fnanchor_559"></a><a href="#footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></span>
What miserable sophism!
How could Epicurus say such a thing before having explained
clearly and without amphibology, what the origin of good
and evil is, so as to prove that the gods indeed do not cooperate
either for the augmentation of the one, or the
diminution of the other? But Epicurus had never dreamed
of giving this explanation. However little he might have
considered it, he would have seen that in whatever fashion
he had given it, it would have overthrown the doctrine of
atoms; for a sole principle, whatever it may be, cannot
produce at the same time good and evil. Nevertheless,
if he has not explained this origin, and if he has not shown
in a peremptory way that we are in a sphere where absolute
evil reigns, and that consequently we can have no sort of
communication with that wherein good resides, it will remain
always evident that if we are not in such a sphere,
and if we possess a portion of good, this good must come to
us from the sphere wherein absolute good has its source.
Now, this sphere is precisely that in which Epicurus places
the gods.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_560" id="fnanchor_560"></a><a href="#footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></span>
But, perhaps, a defender of Epicurus will
say, the good that we possess comes to us only once from
the divine sphere and thenceforth it comes to us no more.
This is contrary to the most intimate and most general
notion that we have of the Divinity, to that of its immutability
upon which Epicurus himself leans most, and from which
it results that the gods could never be what they have
been, nor do what they have done.</p>

<p>In one word, just as well as in a thousand, any maker of
a system is obliged to do one of two things, either to declare
himself what the origin is of good and evil, or to admit
<i>a priori</i> the theosophical dogma of the liberty of man. Epicurus
knew this, and although this dogma might ruin his
system completely, he preferred to admit it than expose
himself to give an explanation beyond his capability and
beyond that of all men. But if man is free, he can be counselled;
if he can be counselled, it is evident that he can,
even that he must, demand counsel. This is the rational
principle of prayer. Now, common sense is the asking for
counsel wiser than its own, and sagacity shows in the Gods
the source of wisdom.</p>

<p>Epicurus, nevertheless, denied the intervention of divine
Providence and pretended that the Gods, absorbed in their
supreme felicity, do not mingle in any
affair.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_561" id="fnanchor_561"></a><a href="#footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></span>
A single
question, simple and naïve, would overthrow this assertion
destitute of proofs, and besides, inconsistent with the conduct
of Greek philosophy; but I prefer to leave this question to
Bayle, who has expended much logic in sustaining this point.
This French philosopher, under pretext of making Epicurus
dispute with a polytheistic priest, advances against Providence
an argument which he believes irresistible, and which
is, indeed, one of the most subtle that one could possibly advance.
“Are the gods satisfied with their administration or
are they dissatisfied? Be mindful,” he says, “of my dilemma:
if they are satisfied with what comes to pass under their
providence, they are pleased with evil; if they are dissatisfied,
they are unhappy.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_562" id="fnanchor_562"></a><a href="#footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></span>
The manner in which Bayle throws
himself into the midst of the question, without examining
the principles of it, denounces him as a skeptic; it is necessary
therefore to use against him the weapons that I
have given against skepticism; that is, to bring him back
abruptly to the principles, by interrogating him before replying
to him. It is necessary to ask him, if he admits a difference
between that which is and that which is not? He is
forced to admit it, as I have said; for in whatever region
of himself his will takes refuge, whether it exercises its
judgment in the instinct, in the understanding or in the
intelligence, you will pursue it in him opposing, in the first
case, the axiom of common sense: nothing is made from
nothing; in the second, that of reason: that which is, is;
in the last, that of sagacity: everything has its opposite
and can have only one. Nothing is made from nothing
therefore that which is not, can never produce that which is.
That which is, is; therefore, that which is not, is not that
which is. Everything has its opposite and can have only
one; therefore the absolute opposite of that which is, is
that which is not. If the skeptic refuses himself the evidence
of common sense, of reason and of sagacity united, he
lies to his conscience, or he is mad and then one must leave
him.</p>

<p>The difference admitted between that which is and that
which is not, proceeds therefore against Bayle, or against
those who resemble him; ask them if man is a prey to absolute
evil, whether physical or moral? They will reply to
you, no; for they will feel that if they should respond otherwise,
you would prove to them that not having the faculty
of making a difference between good and evil, nor of comparing
them together, they could never draw from this
comparison their strongest argument against Providence.
They will, therefore, reply that man is not a prey to absolute
evil, but to a very great relative evil; as great as they wish.
You, nevertheless continue thus: if man is not a prey to
absolute evil, he might be, since it would suffice for this to
take away the sum of good which mitigates the evil, and
which the difference, previously established between that
which is and that which is not, teaches to distinguish. Now,
this sum of good, whence comes it? Who dispenses it?
Who? If the skeptics are silent, affirm for them that it
emanates from the gods themselves and that Providence
is the dispenser. Then reply to their dilemma, and say
that the gods are content with their administration and
that they have reason to be, since by it they procure a
sum of good increasing more and more, for the beings which
without Providence would never know it; and that their
Providence, which has mitigated evil from its origin, mitigates
it still and will mitigate it to its end; and if the astonished
skeptics object that Providence takes a great deal of
time to make what should be made in an instant, reply to
them that it is not a question of knowing how nor why it
makes things, but only that it makes them; which is proved
by the overthrow of their dilemma; and which, after all,
is saying with more reason in this circumstance than in any
other, that time has nothing to do with the affair, since it
is nothing to Providence, although for us it may be much.</p>

<p>And if, continuing to draw inferences from your reasoning,
the skeptics say to you that, according to the continual
effusion of good which you establish, the sum ought to be
daily augmented, whilst that of evil, diminishing in the
same proportion, ought at last to disappear wholly, which
they cannot believe; reply, that the inferences of a reasoning
which confounds theirs are at their disposal; that they
can deduce from them as much as they wish; without engaging
you, for that matter, to discuss the extent of their
view, either in the past, or in the future, because each one
has his own; that, besides, you owe it to truth to teach them
that the dogma, by means of which you have ruined the
laborious structure of their logic, is no other than a theosophical
tradition, universally received from one end of the
earth to the other, as it is easy to prove to them.</p>

<p>Open the sacred books of the Chinese, the Burmans,
Indians, and Persians, you will find there the unequivocal
traces of this dogma. Here, it is Providence represented
under the traits of a celestial virgin, who, sent by the Supreme
Being, furnished arms to combat and to subjugate the
genius of evil, and to bring to perfection everything that it
had corrupted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_563" id="fnanchor_563"></a><a href="#footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></span>
There, it is the Universe itself and the
Worlds which compose it, which are signalized as the instrument
employed by this same Providence to attain this
end.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_564" id="fnanchor_564"></a><a href="#footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></span>
Such was the secret doctrine of the
mysteries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_565" id="fnanchor_565"></a><a href="#footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></span>
Good and
Evil were represented in the sanctuaries under the emblems
of light and darkness: the formidable spectacle of the combat
between these two opposed principles was given there
to the initiate; and after many scenes of terror, the most
obscure night was insensibly succeeded by the purest and
most brilliant day.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_566" id="fnanchor_566"></a><a href="#footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></span>
It was exactly this that Zoroaster
had publicly taught.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Ormuzd [said this theosophist] knew by his sovereign science
that at first he could in no way influence Ahriman; but that
afterwards he united with him and that at last he finished by
subjugating him and changing him to such a degree that the
Universe existed without evil for a duration of
centuries.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_567" id="fnanchor_567"></a><a href="#footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></span>
When the end of the world comes [he said in another place]
the wickedest of the infernal spirits will be pure, excellent,
celestial: yes [he adds], he will become celestial, this liar, this evil
doer; he will become holy, celestial, excellent, this cruel one:
vice itself, breathing only virtue, will make long offerings of
praise to Ormuzd before all the
world.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_568" id="fnanchor_568"></a><a href="#footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>These words are the more remarkable when one considers
that the dogma relating to the downfall of the rebellious angel
has passed from the cosmogony of the Parsees into that of
the Hebrews, and that it is upon this dogma alone, imperfectly
interpreted by the vulgar, that the contradictory
doctrine of the eternity of evil and the torments that follow
it, have been founded. This doctrine, but little understood,
has been sharply
attacked.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_569" id="fnanchor_569"></a><a href="#footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></span>
Simon, very inappropriately
surnamed the <i>Magician</i>, forced St. Peter himself,
disputing with him, to acknowledge that the Hebraic writings
had said nothing positive on this
subject.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_570" id="fnanchor_570"></a><a href="#footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></span>
This is
certain. These writings, interpreted as they have been by
the Hellenic Jews and given out under the name of <i>Version
of the Septuagint</i>, shed no light upon this important point;
but it is well to know that these interpreters have designedly
concealed this light, in order not to divulge the meaning of
their sacred book. If one understood thoroughly the language
of Moses, one would see that, far from setting aside
the theosophical traditions which he had received in Egypt,
this theocratic legislator remained constantly faithful to
them. The passage in his Sepher where he speaks of the
annihilation of Evil, in the meaning of Zoroaster, is in chapter
<abbr title="three, verse">iii., v.</abbr> 15, of the part vulgarly called <i>Genesis</i>, as I hope one
day to show.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_571" id="fnanchor_571"></a><a href="#footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></span>
But without entering at this time, into
the discussion where the real translation of this passage
would lead me, let it suffice to say that the early Christians
were very far from admitting the eternity of evil; for without
speaking of Manes and his numerous followers who
shared the opinion of
Zoroaster,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_572" id="fnanchor_572"></a><a href="#footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></span>
those who are versed
in these sorts of matters know that Origen taught that
torments will not be eternal, and that demons, instructed
by chastisement, will be converted at last and will obtain
their pardon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_573" id="fnanchor_573"></a><a href="#footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></span>
He was followed in this by a great number
of learned men, by the evidence of Beausobre who quotes,
on this subject, the example of a philosopher of Edessa,
who maintained that after the consummation of the ages, all
creatures would become consubstantial with
God.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_574" id="fnanchor_574"></a><a href="#footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing worthy of notice is that Zoroaster, who has
made prayer one of the principal dogmas of his religion, has
been imitated in this by Mohammed, who, unknowingly,
perhaps, has borrowed a great number of things from this
ancient legislator of the Parsees. It is presumable that the
followers of Manes, having retired to Arabia, were responsible
for these borrowings, by the opinions that they circulated
there. But, it must be frankly stated, this dogma,
quite in its place in the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, does not appear so
consistent in the <cite>Koran</cite>, for, of what use is it in a cult where
the predestination of men, necessitated by the Prescient
and All-Powerful Divine, delivers irresistibly the greatest
part of them to an eternal damnation, on account of the
original stain imprinted upon mankind by the sin of the
first man? One cannot be prevented, in reflecting upon this
manifest contradiction, from believing that the theosophical
tradition pertaining to the free will of man, and the influencing
action of Providence operating the progressive augmentation
of good and the gradual diminution of evil,
announced openly by Zoroaster, must have acted secretly
in the mind of the theocratic legislator of Arabia. If it
had not been thus, the prayers that he ordered as one of the
first and most essential duties of the religion, would have
been without object.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of Pythagoras revealed by
Hierocles, two things agree in the efficacy of prayer: the
voluntary movement of our soul, and aid from heaven.
The first of these things is that which seeks goodness; and
the other that which shows it. Prayer is a medium between
our quest and the celestial gift. One seeks, one prays in
vain, if one adds not prayer to research and research to
prayer. Virtue is an emanation from God; it is like a
reflected image of the Divinity, the resemblance of which
alone constitutes the good and the beautiful. The soul
which is attached to this admirable type of all perfection
is aroused to prayer by its inclination to virtue, and it augments
this inclination by the effusion of the goodness which
it receives by means of prayer; so that it does precisely
what it demands and demands what it
does.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_575" id="fnanchor_575"></a><a href="#footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></span>
Socrates
was not far from the doctrine of Pythagoras in this respect;
he added only, that prayer exacted much precaution
and prudence, lest, without perceiving it, one demand of
God great evils, in thinking to ask great blessings.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The sage [he said] knows what he ought to say or do; the
fool is ignorant of it; the one implores in prayer, what can be
really useful to him; the other desires often things which, being
granted him, become for him the source of greatest misfortunes.
The prudent man [he adds], however little he may doubt himself,
ought to resign himself to Providence who knows better than he,
the consequences that things must have.</p>

<p>This is why Socrates cited as a model of sense and reason
this prayer of an ancient poet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Grant us good whether prayed for or unsought by us;</div>
<div class="i0">But that which we ask amiss, do thou
avert.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_576" id="fnanchor_576"></a><a href="#footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></span></div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The prayer was, as I have said, one of the principal
dogmas of the religion of
Zoroaster<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_577" id="fnanchor_577"></a><a href="#footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></span>:
the Persians also
had the greatest confidence therein. Like the Chaldeans,
they founded all magical power upon its efficacy. They
still possess today certain kinds of prayers for conjuring
maladies and driving away demons. These prayers, which
they name <i>tavids</i>, are written upon strips of paper and carried
after the manner of
talismans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_578" id="fnanchor_578"></a><a href="#footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></span>
It is quite well-known
that the modern Jews use them in the same way.
In this they imitate, as in innumerable other things, the
ancient Egyptians whose secret doctrine Moses has transmitted
to them.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_579" id="fnanchor_579"></a><a href="#footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></span>
The early Christians were inclined to
theosophical ideas on this subject. Origen explains it
clearly in speaking of the virtue attached to certain names
invoked by the Egyptian sages and the most enlightened
of the magians of Persia.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_580" id="fnanchor_580"></a><a href="#footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></span>
Synesius, the famous Bishop
of Ptolemaïs, initiated into the mysteries, declares that the
science, by means of which one linked the intelligible essences
to sentient forms, by the invocation of spirits, was
neither vain nor criminal, but on the contrary quite innocent
and founded upon the nature of
things.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_581" id="fnanchor_581"></a><a href="#footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></span>
Pythagoras
was accused of magic. Ignorance and weakness of mind
have always charged science with this banal
accusation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_582" id="fnanchor_582"></a><a href="#footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></span>
This philosopher, rightly placed in the rank of the ablest
physicians of
Greece,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_583" id="fnanchor_583"></a><a href="#footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></span>
was, according to his most devoted
disciples, neither of the number of the gods, nor even of
those of the divine heroes; he was a man whom virtue and
wisdom had adorned with a likeness to the gods, by the
complete purifying of his understanding which had been
effected through contemplation and
prayer.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_584" id="fnanchor_584"></a><a href="#footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></span>
This is what
Lysis expressed by the following lines:</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">27. <i>Instructed by them, naught shall then deceive thee;<br />
            &ensp;Of diverse beings thou shalt sound the essence;<br />
            &ensp;And thou shalt know the principle and end of All.</i></p>

<p>That is to say, that the true disciple of Pythagoras,
placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(en rapport)</i> with the gods through contemplation,
arrived at the highest degree of perfection, called in the
mysteries, autopsy; saw fall before him the false veil which
until then had hidden Truth, and contemplated Nature in
its remotest sources. It is necessary, in order to attain to
this sublime degree, that the intelligence, penetrated by
the divine ray of inspiration, should fill the understanding
with a light intense enough to dissipate all the illusions of
the senses, to exalt the soul and release it wholly from things
material. Thus it was explained by Socrates and
Plato.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_585" id="fnanchor_585"></a><a href="#footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></span>
These philosophers and their numerous disciples put no limit
to the advantages of autopsy, or theophany, as they sometimes
named this highest degree of the telestic science. They
believed that the contemplation of God could be carried so
far during this same life, that the soul became not only
united to this Being of beings, but that it was mingled and
blended with it. Plotinus boasted having experienced the
joy of this beatific vision four times, according to Porphyry,
who himself claimed to have been honoured with it at the
age of sixty-eight.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_586" id="fnanchor_586"></a><a href="#footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></span>
The great aim of the mysteries was
to teach the initiates the possibility of this union of man with
God, and to indicate to them the means. All initiations, all
mythological doctrines, tended only to alleviate the soul of
the weight of material things, to purify it, so that, desirous
of spiritual welfare, and being projected beyond the circle
of generations, it could rise to the source of its
existence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_587" id="fnanchor_587"></a><a href="#footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></span>
If one examines carefully the different cults which still
dominate upon earth, one will see that they have not been
animated by any other spirit. The knowledge of the Being
of beings has been offered everywhere as the aim of wisdom;
its similitude, as the crown of perfection; and its enjoyment,
as the object of all desires and the goal of all efforts. The
enumeration of its infinite faculties has varied; but when one
has dared fix one’s attention upon the unity of its essence,
one has always defined it as has Pythagoras: the principle
and the end of all things.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Spirit whence proceed the created beings [say the
Brahmans], by which they live after being emanated from it,
toward which they aspire, and in which they are finally absorbed,
this Spirit is that, to the knowledge of which thou shouldst
aspire, the Great Being.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_588" id="fnanchor_588"></a><a href="#footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></span>

&mdash;&#8203;It

and its will suffices to move all
intelligences.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_590" id="fnanchor_590"></a><a href="#footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></span>

is no other God than it. The Universe is filled with its immensity.
It is the principle of all things without having
principles.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_592" id="fnanchor_592"></a><a href="#footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></span>
God is one,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_593" id="fnanchor_593"></a><a href="#footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></span>
eternal, like unto a perfect sphere which has
neither beginning nor end. He rules and governs all that exists
by a general providence, resultant of fixed and determined
principles. Man ought not to seek to penetrate the nature or
the essence of this Ineffable Being: such a research is vain and
criminal.&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus do the Hindu sages express themselves in sundry
places. They commend aspiring to the knowledge of the
Being of beings, making oneself worthy to be absorbed in
its bosom; and forbid, at the same time, seeking to penetrate
its nature. I have already said that such was the doctrine
of the mysteries. I am about to add an important reflection
in order to cast some light upon a doctrine which, at
first glance, appears contradictory.</p>

<p>Man, who aspires by the inner movement of his will, to
attain to the highest degree of human perfection, and who,
by the purification of his understanding, and the acquisition
of celestial virtues, puts himself in a state to receive the
truth, must observe that the higher he rises in the intelligible
sphere, the nearer he approaches to the unfathomable Being
whose contemplation must make his happiness, the less he
can communicate the knowledge of it to others; for truth,
coming to him under intelligible forms more and more universalized,
can never be contained in the rational or sentient
forms that he might give it. Here is the point where many
mystic contemplators have gone astray. As they had never
adequately fathomed the triple modification of their being,
and as they had not known the intimate composition of the
human Quaternary, they were ignorant of the manner in
which the transformation of ideas was made, as much in
the ascendant progression as in the descendant progression;
so that, confusing continually understanding and intelligence,
and making no difference between the products of their will
according as it acted in one or the other of its modifications,
they often showed the opposite of what they intended to
show; and instead of the seers that they might, perhaps,
have been, they became visionaries. I could give a great
many examples of these aberrations; but I will limit myself
to a single one, because the man who furnishes it for me,
immeasurably great on the side of intelligence, lacked understanding
and felt keenly himself, the weakness of his reason.
This man, whose audacious gaze has penetrated as far as the
divine sanctuary, is a German shoemaker of obscure birth,
called Jacob Boehme. The rusticity of his mind, the roughness
of his character, and more than all that, the force and
the number of his prejudices, render his works almost unintelligible
and therefore repel the savants. But when one
has the patience and talent necessary to separate the pure
gold from its dross and from its alloy, one can find there
things which are nowhere else. These things, which present
themselves nearly always under the oddest and most absurd
forms, have taken them by passing from his intelligence to
his instinct, without his reason having had the force to oppose
itself. This is how he artlessly expresses this transformation
of ideas: “Now that I have raised myself so high, I dare not
look back for fear that giddiness may seize me … for as
long as I ascend, I am convinced of my impulse; but it is not
the same when I turn my head and when I wish to descend;
then I am troubled, I am bewildered, it seems to me that I
shall fall.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_594" id="fnanchor_594"></a><a href="#footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></span>
And in truth he fell so rapidly that he did
not perceive, either the terrible disparity between his ideas
and his expressions, nor the manifest contradictions into
which his prejudices had drawn him.</p>

<p>These grave disadvantages, which do not strike the vulgar,
were perfectly understood and appreciated by the sages.
The institutors of the mysteries were not ignorant of them
and it is for this that they had imposed the most absolute
silence upon the initiates and particularly upon the epopts,
to whom they gave their highest teachings. They made
them feel readily that intelligible things can only become
sentient by being transformed, and that this transformation
requires a talent and an authority even, which cannot be
the appanage of all men.</p>

<p>I am now at the close of my reflection. The diverse cults
established upon earth are but the transformations of ideas;
that is to say, particular forms of religion, by means of which
a theocratic legislator or theosophic sage renders sentient
that which is intelligible, and puts within reach of all men
what, without these forms, would have been only within
reach of a very small number; now, these transformations
can only be effected in three ways, according to the three
faculties of the human Ternary; the fourth, which concerns
its Quaternary or its relative unity, being impossible. I beg
the reader to recall what I have said, touching the intimate
composition and movement of this Quaternary, and grant
me a little attention.</p>

<p>The aim of all the cults being to conduct to the knowledge
of the Divinity, they differ only by the route that they travel
in its attainment, and this route depends always upon the
manner in which the Divinity has been considered by the
founder of the cult. If this founder has considered it in his
intelligence, he has seen the Divinity in its universal modifications,
and, therefore, triple, as the Universe; if he has
considered it in his understanding, he has seen it in its
creative principles, and, therefore, double as Nature; if he
has considered it in his instinct, he has seen it in its faculties
and its attributes, and, therefore, infinite, as Matter; if he has
considered it, finally, in its proper volitive unity, acting at
once in its three modifications, he has seen this same Divinity
according to the force and movement of his thought,
either in its absolute essence or in its universal essence; that
is, One in its cause, or One in its effects. Examine closely
what I have said and see if there exists a single cult upon the
face of the earth that you may not connect with one of the
kinds whose origin I have indicated.</p>

<p>I have said that the Divinity, considered in the human
intelligence, is shown under the emblem of the universal
Ternary; hence all the cults which are dominated by three
principal gods as in
India,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_595" id="fnanchor_595"></a><a href="#footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></span>
in Greece and in
Italy,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_596" id="fnanchor_596"></a><a href="#footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></span>
three
principal modifications in the same God, as in
China,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_597" id="fnanchor_597"></a><a href="#footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></span>
in
Japan, in Tibet and among the considerable followers of
Fo-Hi or Buddha.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_598" id="fnanchor_598"></a><a href="#footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></span>
This cult, which has been called that
of the <i>Tritheists</i>, is one of the most widespread on earth,
and one which has mingled most easily with the others. It
pleases the imagination and gives to wisdom great power to
rise to intelligible truths.</p>

<p>I have said that the Divinity, considered in the human
understanding, is manifest under the emblem of two natural
principles: hence, all the cults wherein two opposed beings
appear, as in the cult of Zoroaster. This cult, which is
rarely encountered as pure as among the ancient Persians,
or among the followers of Manes, mingles readily with
tritheism and even polytheism: it was quite recognizable
in Egypt and among the Scandinavians, and much more
involved among the Indians, Greeks, and Latins. This cult
could be considered as a natural <i>Diarchy</i>, and those who
follow it, <i>Diarchists</i>. Judgment and reason conform very
well in it; one also sees ordinarily, profound reasoners and
skeptics, inclining there <i>nolens
volens</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_599" id="fnanchor_599"></a><a href="#footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></span>
Its abuse leads to
atheism; but it offers great means, when one knows how to
make good use of it, to penetrate the essence of things and
succeed to the explanation of natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Again I say, that the Divinity considered in the instinct
is presented under the emblem of material infinity: hence,
all cults where, by a contrary movement, the intelligible
becomes sentient and the sentient intelligible; as when the
attributes and faculties of the Divinity are particularized
and personified, and as the agents of Nature, the parts of the
Universe and the individual beings themselves, are deified.
This cult, to which I have given the name of <i>Polytheism</i>, is
everywhere, under different forms and under different names,
the portion of the vulgar. More or less apparent it insinuates
itself in the midst of the other two, multiplies the images of
the intellectual modifications and the natural principles, and
whatever attentions the theosophists bring to forestall its
invasion, end by stifling utterly the spirit of it beneath the
material covering which envelops them. This cult, the cradle
of all religions, with which the other two can never entirely
dispense, which nourishes and lives in their life, is also the
tomb. It pleases singularly that faculty of man which is
developed first, sense perception; it aids the development of
instinct and can, by the sole medium of common sense, lead
to the knowledge of the natural principles. Its abuse precipitates
peoples into idolatry and superstition; its good use
arouses the talents and gives birth to heroic virtues. One
becomes artist or hero through the exaltation of Polytheism;
savant or philosopher through that of Diarchy; and sage or
theosophist through that of Tritheism. These three cults,
whether pure or variously mixed, are the only ones in which
transformation may be possible; that is to say, which may be
clothed in ostensible forms and enclosed in any sort of ritual.
The fourth cult, which is founded upon the absolute unity
of God, is not transformable. This is the reason.</p>

<p>The Divinity considered in the volitive unity of man,
acting at the same time in its principal faculties, is manifested
finally, in its absolute essence, or in its universal
essence; One in its cause, or One in its effects: thence, not
only all public cults, but all secret mysteries, all doctrines
mystic and contemplative; for how can that which has no
likeness to anything be represented? How render sentient
that which is beyond all intelligence? What expressions
will be consistent with that which is inexpressible, with that
which is more ineffable than silence itself? What temples
will one raise to that which is incomprehensible, inaccessible,
unfathomable? The theosophists and sages have realized
these difficulties; they have seen that it was necessary to
suppress all discourse, to set aside all simulacra: to renounce
all enclosures, to annihilate finally all sentient objects
or to be exposed to give false ideas of the absolute essence
of a Being that neither time nor space can contain. Many
have dared the undertaking. One knows, in delving into
ages long since past, that the ancient Magians of Persia
erected no temple and set up no
statue.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_600" id="fnanchor_600"></a><a href="#footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></span>
The Druids
acted in the same manner.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_601" id="fnanchor_601"></a><a href="#footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></span>
The former invoked the
Principle of all things upon the summits of mountains; the
latter, in the depths of the forests. Both deemed it unworthy
of the divine Majesty to enclose it within precincts
and to represent it by a material
image.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_602" id="fnanchor_602"></a><a href="#footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></span>
It even appears
that the early Romans shared this
opinion.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_603" id="fnanchor_603"></a><a href="#footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></span>
But this
cult, entirely intellectual and destitute of forms, could not
subsist long. Perceptible objects were needed by the people,
on which they might place their ideas. These objects, even
in spite of the legislator who sought to proscribe them,
insinuated themselves.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_604" id="fnanchor_604"></a><a href="#footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></span>
Images, statues, temples were
multiplied notwithstanding the laws which prohibited them.
At that time if the cult did not undergo a salutary reform, it
was changed, either into a gross anthropomorphism, or into
an absolute materialism: that is to say, that a man of the
people being unable to rise to the divine Unity, drew it down
to his level; and the savant, being unable to comprehend
it and believing nevertheless to grasp it, confused it with
Nature.</p>

<p>It was to evade this inevitable catastrophe that the
sages and theosophists had, as I have said, made a mystery
of the Unity of God, and had concealed it in the inmost
recesses of the sanctuaries. It was only after many trials,
and not until the initiate was judged worthy to be admitted
to the sublime degree of autopsy, that the last veil was lifted
to his gaze, and the principle and end of all things, the Being
of beings, in all its unfathomable Unity, was delivered to his
contemplation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_605" id="fnanchor_605"></a><a href="#footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">28. <i>If Heaven wills it, thou shalt know that Nature,<br />
            &ensp;Alike in everything, is the same in every place.</i></p>

<p>I have already said that the homogeneity of Nature was,
with the unity of God, one of the greatest secrets of the
mysteries. Pythagoras founded this homogeneity upon the
unity of the spirit by which it is penetrated and from which,
according to him, all our souls draw their
origin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_606" id="fnanchor_606"></a><a href="#footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></span>
This
dogma which he had received from the Chaldeans and from
the priests of Egypt was admitted by all the sages of antiquity,
as is proved at great length by Stanley and the
astute Beausobre.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_607" id="fnanchor_607"></a><a href="#footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></span>
These sages established a harmony, a
perfect analogy between heaven and earth, the intelligible
and the sentient, the indivisible substance and the divisible
substance; in such a manner that that which took place in one
of the regions of the Universe or of the modifications of the
primordial Ternary was the exact image of that which took
place in the other. This idea is found very forcibly revealed
by the ancient Thoth, called <dfn>Hermes
Trismegistus</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_608" id="fnanchor_608"></a><a href="#footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></span>
by the
Greeks, in the table of Emerald which is attributed to him.</p>

<p class="blockquote">In truth, and without fiction, in truth, in truth, I say to
you, that things inferior are like unto the superior; both unite
their invincible forces to produce one sole thing, the most marvellous
of all, and as all things are emanated by the will of one
unique God, thus all things whatsoever must be engendered by
this sole thing,&mdash;&#8203;by a disposition of Universal
nature.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_609" id="fnanchor_609"></a><a href="#footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></span></p>

<p>I must say, however, that it is upon the homogeneity of
Nature that were founded in the principle all the so-called
occult sciences of which the principal four, relating to the
human Quaternary, were Theurgy, Astrology, Magic, and
Chemistry.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_610" id="fnanchor_610"></a><a href="#footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></span>
I have already spoken of the astrological
science, and I have given sufficient evidence of what I think
regarding the ridiculous and petty ideas concerning it that
the modems have conceived. I will refrain from speaking
of the other three, on account of the prolixities into which
the discussions that they would provoke might lure me.
In another work I will endeavour to show that the principles
upon which they were supported differed greatly from those
which superstition and blind credulity have given them in
times of ignorance; and that the sciences taught to the initiates
in the ancient sanctuaries, under the names of Theurgy,
Magic, or Chemistry, differed much from what the vulgar
have understood in later times by the same words.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">29. <i>So that, as to thy true rights enlightened,<br />
            &ensp;Thine heart shall no more feed on vain desires.</i></p>

<p>That is to say, that the disciple of Pythagoras, having
attained through knowledge of himself to that of truth,
ought to judge sanely of the possibility or impossibility of
things, and to find in wisdom itself that just mean which he
has found in virtue and in science. Equally distant from
that blind credulity which admits and seeks without reflection
the things most incompatible with the laws of Nature,
and from that presumptuous ignorance which rejects and
denies without examination all those things which issue from
the narrow circle of its empirical notions; he should understand
with exactness the limits and the forces of Nature,
know instantly what is contained therein or what exceeds
them, and not form any vow, any project, or any enterprise
beyond his power.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">30. <i>Thou shalt see that the evils which devour men<br />
            &ensp;Are of their choice the fruit.…</i></p>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the most important things for man
to understand is the nearest cause of his evils, so that,
ceasing from murmuring against Providence, he may blame
only himself for the misfortunes of which he is the proper
artisan. Ignorance, always weak and presumptuous, concealing
its own mistakes, holds responsible, with their
consequences, the things which are most foreign there: thus
the child which hurts itself, threatens with his voice and
strikes with his hand the wall against which he has stumbled.
Of all errors this is the most common. Likewise he acknowledges
with as much difficulty his own wrongs as he accuses
with ease those of others. This baleful habit of imputing to
Providence the evils which afflict humanity has furnished,
as we have seen, the strongest arguments to the skeptics to
attack its influence, and to undermine thus in its foundation
the very existence of the Divinity. All peoples have been
guilty of
this<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_611" id="fnanchor_611"></a><a href="#footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></span>;
but the moderns are, as I believe, the only
ones who coldly and without passion, in order to sustain
certain opinions that they have embraced, have raised
systematically their ignorance concerning the cause of evil,
and made an irresistible fatality proceed from the All-Powerful
and divine Prescience, which drawing man on to
vice and misfortune, damns him by force; and by a consequence
determined by the will of God, delivers him to eternal
sufferings.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_612" id="fnanchor_612"></a><a href="#footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></span>
Such were those among the Christians of the
fifth century, who were named Predestinarians on account
of their terrible system. Their opinion, it is true, was condemned
by the councils of Arles and
Lyon<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_613" id="fnanchor_613"></a><a href="#footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></span>;
but they
declared that the church fell into inconsistency, since the
sentiment in this respect, being exactly conformable with
that which Saint Augustine had advanced against the Pelagians,
this church could not condemn the one without
condemning the other and therefore, without deciding in
favour of the opposed doctrine which they had already
condemned. It is certain that the Predestinarians were
right on this last point, as well as Gotescalc, Baius, and Jansenius,
who, with the book of Saint Augustine in hand,
proved it later on, by causing in this church, at different
times, troubles more or less violent on the subject.</p>

<p>This is the moment to complete the proofs of what I
advanced in my Seventh Examination, that the liberty of
man can be established only by the sole theosophical tradition,
and the assent that all the sages of the earth have given
to it; and that there is no doctrine, which, becoming separated,
does not abandon the Universe to the irresistible impulse of
an absolute fatality. I have shown sufficiently the emptiness
of all the cosmogonical systems, whether their authors have
founded them upon a sole principle or upon two, upon spirit
or upon matter; I have sufficiently indicated the danger
that would have ensued from divulging the secret dogma of
divine Unity, since this disclosure drew with it the necessity
of explaining the origin of Good and Evil, which was impossible;
I have cited the example of Moses, and I have
demonstrated as a decisive point in this matter that those
of his followers who rejected the oral tradition of this great
man, to attach themselves to the literal meaning only of his
Sepher, fell into fatalism and were led to make God himself
the author of Evil; finally I have announced that Christianity
and Islamism, issuing alike from the Mosaic doctrine,
have not been able to evade the dogma of predestination:
this dogma, although often repulsed by the Christian and
Mussulman doctors, alarmed at its consequences, is shown,
none the less, from the facts. The Koran which teaches it
openly exempts me from other proofs in defence of the Mussulmans.
Let us turn to the Christians.</p>

<p>It is certain that one of the greatest men of the primitive
church, Origen, perceiving to what consequences the explanation
of the origin of Evil led, by the way in which it was
vulgarly understood, according to the literal translation of
the Sepher of Moses, undertook to bring all back to allegory,
recalling Christianity being born to the theosophical tradition
pertaining to the free will of
man<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_614" id="fnanchor_614"></a><a href="#footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></span>;
but his books,
wherein he exposed this tradition according to the doctrine
of Pythagoras and
Plato,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_615" id="fnanchor_615"></a><a href="#footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></span>
were burned as heretical, by
the order of Pope
Gelasius.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_616" id="fnanchor_616"></a><a href="#footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></span>
The church at that time
paid little attention to the blow dealt by Origen, occupied
as it was with examining the principal dogmas of incarnation,
of the divinity of Jesus, of the consubstantiality of the Word,
of the Unity of its person and the duality of its nature; but
when, following the energetic expression of Plucquet, the
flame of conflagration had passed over all these opinions,
and when the waves of blood had drenched the ashes, it was
necessary to offer new food for its activity. An English
monk named Pelagius,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_617" id="fnanchor_617"></a><a href="#footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></span>
born with an ardent and impetuous
mind, was the foremost to attack this thorny question
of the liberty of man, and, wishing to establish it, was led
to deny original sin.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Man [he said] is free to do good or evil: he who tries to lay
the blame of his vices on the weakness of nature, is unjust: for
what is sin, in general? Is it a thing that one may evade, or
not? If one cannot evade it, there is no evil in committing it
and then it does not exist: if one can evade it, it must be evil to
commit it and therefore it exists: its very existence is born of the
free will, and proves
it.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_618" id="fnanchor_618"></a><a href="#footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></span>
The dogma of original sin [continued
Pelagius] is absurd and unjust to God; for a creature which does
not exist would not be an accomplice of a bad action; and it
outrages divine justice, to say that God punishes him as guilty
of this action.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_619" id="fnanchor_619"></a><a href="#footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></span>
Man [added Pelagius] has therefore a real power
of doing good and evil, and he is free in these two respects.
But the liberty of doing a thing supposes necessarily the union
of all causes and of all conditions requisite for doing that thing;
and one is not free regarding an effect, every time that one of
the causes or conditions naturally exigent for producing this
effect is lacking. Therefore, to have the liberty of seeing the
subjects, it is necessary not only that the sense of sight be well
developed, but also that the subjects be discriminated, and
placed at an equitable
distance.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_620" id="fnanchor_620"></a><a href="#footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></span></p>

<p>This far, the doctrine of Pelagius was wholly similar to
that of Pythagoras, as explained by
Hierocles<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_621" id="fnanchor_621"></a><a href="#footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></span>;
but it
differs from it afterwards, in what the English monk asserted,
that since man is born with the liberty of doing good and evil,
he receives from nature and unites in him all the conditions
and all the causes naturally necessary for good and evil;
which robs him of his most beautiful prerogative,&mdash;&#8203;perfectibility;
whereas Pythagoras held, on the contrary, that these
causes and these effects were only accorded to those who,
on their part, concurred in acquiring them, and who, by the
work that they have done for themselves in seeking to know
themselves, have succeeded in possessing them more and
more perfectly.</p>

<p>However mitigated the doctrine of Pelagius might be, it
appeared still to accord too much with free will and was
condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities, who declared,
through the medium of several councils, that man can do
nothing of himself without the aid of grace. Saint Augustine,
who had been the soul of these councils, pressed by the disciple
of Pelagius to explain the nature of this grace and to
say how God accorded it to one man rather than to another
without being induced by the difference of their merits,
replied that man being in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(masse de perdition)</i>, and God
having no need of them, and being furthermore independent
and all-powerful, he gave grace to whom he willed, without
the one to whom he did not give it having the right to
complain; everything coming to pass as a result of his will,
which had foreseen all and determined
all.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_622" id="fnanchor_622"></a><a href="#footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></span>
Assuredly
one could not establish more forcibly the necessity of all
things, nor submit men to a sterner fatality, since the want
of grace deprived them, not only of virtue in the fleeting
course of this life, but delivered them without hope to the
torments of an eternal hell. But Saint Augustine, who
obeyed a severe and consistent reason, felt very well that he
could not speak otherwise, without renouncing the dogma of
original sin and overthrowing the foundation of Christianity.
All the rigid Christians, all those who, at different times,
have undertaken to restore Christianity to its constitutive
principles, have thought as Saint Augustine, and although
the church, alarmed at the terrible inferences that were
drawn from the canonical doctrine, may have essayed to
temper it, by condemning, as I have said, the Predestinarians
and by approving of the persecutions directed against
Gotescalc; and, at the time when Luther drew in his reform
a great part of Christendom toward the dogma of predestination,
this did not prevent Baius, who remained faithful
to orthodoxy, from preaching the same dogma; nor Calvin,
soon after, from adding new lights to what Luther had left
doubtful, and Jansenius, finally, corroborating what Baius
had only outlined, from raising in the very midst of the
church that formidable faction which all the united efforts
of the Pope and the Jesuits have been unable to convict of
erring in the doctrine of Saint Augustine, which it has sustained
with a force worthy of a better cause.</p>

<p>According to Calvin, who of all of them expresses himself
most clearly, the soul of man, all of whose faculties are
infected with sin, lacks force to resist the temptation which
lures him on toward evil. The liberty of which he prides
himself is a chimera; he confounds the free with the voluntary,
and believes that he chooses freely because there is no
constraint, and that he wills to do the evil that he
does.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_623" id="fnanchor_623"></a><a href="#footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></span>
Thus following the doctrine of this reformer, man, dominated
by his vicious passions, can produce of himself only
wicked actions; and it is to draw him from this state of
corruption and impotence that it was necessary that God
should send his son upon earth to redeem him and to atone
for him; so that it is from the absence of liberty in man that
Calvin draws his strongest proofs of the coming of Christ:
“For,” he said, “if man had been free, and if he had been
able to save himself, it would not have been needful that
God should offer up his Son in
sacrifice.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_624" id="fnanchor_624"></a><a href="#footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></span></p>

<p>This last argument seems irresistible. Besides when the
Jesuits had accused Calvin and his followers of making God
the author of sin, and of destroying thus all idea of the
Divinity<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_625" id="fnanchor_625"></a><a href="#footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></span>
they knew better than to say how it can be
otherwise accomplished. They would not have been able,
without doing a thing impossible for them&mdash;&#8203;that is, without
giving the origin of evil. The difficulty of this explanation,
which Moses, even as I have said, has enveloped with a
triple veil, has in no wise escaped the fathers of the primitive
church. They have well felt that it was the important point
whereon depended the solution of all other questions. But
how can one attempt even the explanation? The most
enlightened among them had agreed that it is an abyss of
nature that one would not know how to
fathom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_626" id="fnanchor_626"></a><a href="#footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 hanging">31. … <i>that these unfortunates<br />
            &ensp;Seek afar the goodness whose source within they bear</i>.</p>

<p>The source of all goodness is wisdom, and wisdom begins
with the knowledge of oneself. Without this knowledge, one
aspires in vain to real goodness. But how is it obtainable?
If you interrogate Plato upon this important point, he will
respond to you, that it is in going back to the essence of
things&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, in considering that which constitutes
man in himself. “A workman, you will say to this philosopher,
is not the same thing as the instrument which he
uses; the one who plays the lyre differs from the lyre upon
which he plays. You will readily agree to this, and the
philosopher, pursuing his reasoning, will add: And the eyes
with which this musician reads his music, and the hands
with which he holds his lyre, are they not also instruments?
Can you deny, if the eyes, if the hands are instruments, that
the whole body may likewise be an instrument, different
from the being who makes use of it and who commands?”
Unquestionably no, and you will comprehend sufficiently
that this being, by which man is really man, is the soul, the
knowledge of which you ought to seek. “For,” Plato will
also tell you, “he who knows his body, only knows that it is
his, and is not himself. To know his body as a physician or
as a sculptor, is an art, to know his soul, as a sage, is a
science and the greatest of all
sciences.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_627" id="fnanchor_627"></a><a href="#footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></span></p>

<p>From the knowledge of himself man passes to that of
God; and it is in fixing this model of all perfection that he
succeeds in delivering himself from the evils which he has
attracted by his own choice.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_628" id="fnanchor_628"></a><a href="#footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></span>
His deliverance depends,
according to Pythagoras, upon virtue and upon
truth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_629" id="fnanchor_629"></a><a href="#footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></span>
The virtue, that he acquires by purification, tempers and
directs the passions; the truth, which he attains by his union
with the Being of beings, dissipates the darkness with which
his intelligence is obsessed; and both of them, acting jointly
in him, give him the divine form, according as he is disposed
to receive it, and guide him to supreme
felicity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_630" id="fnanchor_630"></a><a href="#footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></span>
But how
difficult to obtain this desired goal!</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">32. <i>For few know happiness: playthings of the passions,<br />
            &ensp;Hither, thither tossed by adverse waves,<br />
            &ensp;Upon a shoreless sea, they blinded roll,<br />
            &ensp;Unable to resist or to the tempest yield.</i></p>

<p>Lysis shows in these lines what are the greatest obstacles
to the happiness of man. They are the passions: not the
passions in themselves, but the evil effects that they produce
by the disordered movement that the understanding allows
them to take. It is to this that the attention must be directed
so that one should not fall into the error of the Stoics.
Pythagoras, as I have said, did not command his disciples
to destroy their passions, but to moderate their ardour, and
to guide them well. “The passions,” said this philosopher,
“are given to be aids to reason; it is necessary that they be
its servants and not its masters.” This is a truth that the
Platonists and even the Peripatetics have recognized, by
the evidence of Hierocles.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_631" id="fnanchor_631"></a><a href="#footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></span>
Thus Pythagoras regarded the
passions as instruments of which the understanding makes
use in raising the intellectual edifice. A man utterly deprived
of them would resemble a mass inert and immovable
in the course of life; it is true that he might be able not to
become depraved, but then he could not enjoy his noblest
advantage, which is perfectibility. Reason is established
in the understanding to hold sway over the passions; it must
command them with absolute sovereignty, and make them
tend towards the end that wisdom indicates. If it should not
recognize the laws that intelligence gives it, and if, presumptuously,
it wishes, instead of acting according to given
principles, to lay down principles itself, it falls into excess,
and makes man superstitious or skeptic, fanatic or atheist;
if, on the contrary, it receives laws from the passions that it
ought to rule, and if weak it allows itself to be subjugated
by them, it falls into error and renders man stupid or mad,
brutish in vice, or audacious in crime. There are no true
reasonings except those admitted by wisdom; the false
reasonings must be considered as the cries of an insensate
soul, given over to the movements of an anarchical reason
which the passions confuse and
blind.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_632" id="fnanchor_632"></a><a href="#footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>Pythagoras considered man as holding the mean between
things intellectual and sentient, the lowest of the superior
beings and the highest of the inferior, free to move either
toward the heights or the depths, by means of his passions,
which bring into action the ascending or descending movement
that his will possesses with potentiality; sometimes
being united with the immortals and, through his return to
virtue, recovering the lot which is his own, and other times
plunging again into mortal kind and through transgression
of the divine laws finding himself fallen from his
dignity.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_633" id="fnanchor_633"></a><a href="#footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></span>
This opinion, which had been that of all the sages who had
preceded Pythagoras, has been that of all the sages who have
followed him, even of those among the Christian theosophists
whose religious prejudices have removed them farthest
from his doctrine. I shall not stop to give the proofs of its
antiquity; they are to be found everywhere, and would be
superfluous. Thomas Burnet, having vainly sought for the
origin without being able to discover it, decided that it
was necessary that it should descend from
heaven.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_634" id="fnanchor_634"></a><a href="#footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></span>
It is
certain that one can only with difficulty explain how a man
without erudition, like Boehme, never having received this
opinion from anyone, has been able to explain it so clearly.
“When one sees man existing,” says this theosophist, “one
can say: Here all Eternity is manifested in one
image.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_635" id="fnanchor_635"></a><a href="#footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">The abode of this being is an intermediate point between
heaven and hell, love and anger; that, of the things to which
he is attached, becomes his kind.… If he inclines toward
the celestial nature, he assumes a celestial form, and the human
form becomes infernal if he inclines toward hell; for as the mind
is, so is the body. In whatever way the mind projects itself, it
shadows forth its body with a similar form and a similar
source.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_636" id="fnanchor_636"></a><a href="#footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></span></p>

<p>It is upon this principle, which one finds still everywhere
diversely expressed, that the dogma of the transmigration

and received by all peoples,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_638" id="fnanchor_638"></a><a href="#footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></span>
has been to
such an extent disfigured in what the moderns have called
<i>Metempsychosis</i>, that it would be necessary to exceed considerably
the limits of these Examinations in order to give
an explanation which could be understood. Later I will
endeavour to expose my sentiment upon this mystery, when
I treat of Theurgy and other occult sciences to which it is
allied.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">33. <i>God! Thou couldst save them by opening their eyes.</i></p>

<p>Lysis here approaches openly one of the greatest difficulties
of nature, that which in all time has furnished to the
skeptics and to the atheists the weapons that they have
believed most formidable. Hierocles has not concealed it in
his Commentaries, and he expresses it in these terms: “If
God is able to bring back all men to virtue and to happiness,
and if he does not will to do so, is God therefore unjust and
wicked? Or if he wills to bring them back and if he is unable,
is God therefore weak and
impotent?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_639" id="fnanchor_639"></a><a href="#footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></span>
Long before
Hierocles, Epicurus seized upon this argument to support
his system, and had extended it without augmenting its
force. His design had been to prove by its means that,
according as he had advanced it, God does not interfere with
the things of this world, and that there is, consequently, no
Providence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_640" id="fnanchor_640"></a><a href="#footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></span>
Lactantius, thinking that he was answering
this, has quoted from Epicurus and has afforded Bayle, the
most learned and the most formidable of modern skeptics,
the occasion for demonstrating that, until now, this terrible
argument had remained unrefuted notwithstanding all the
efforts made for its overthrow.</p>

<p>This indefatigable reasoner said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">The evil exists; man is wicked and unhappy: everything
proves this sad truth. History is, properly speaking, only a
miscellany of the crimes and adversities of mankind. However,
at intervals, there have been seen shining some examples of
virtue and happiness. There is, therefore, a mixture of evils
and of moral and physical goodness.… Now, if man is the
work of a sole principle, sovereignly good, sovereignly holy,
sovereignly potential, how is he exposed to the maladies of cold,
heat, hunger, thirst, pain, and sorrow? How has he so many
wicked inclinations? How does he commit so many crimes?
Can the sovereign sanctity produce a criminal creature? Can
the sovereign bounty produce an unfortunate
creature?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_641" id="fnanchor_641"></a><a href="#footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></span></p>

<p>Bayle, content with his anti-providential declaration,
believes that he has triumphed over all the dogmatists of
the world; but whilst he recovers his breath, observe that he
admits a mixture of good and evil, and allow him to continue.</p>

<p>“Origen,” he said, “asserts that evil has come from the
wicked use of the free will. And why has God allowed man
to have so pernicious a free will?” “Because,” Origen
answers, “an intelligent creature who had not enjoyed free
will would have been immutable and immortal as God.”
What pitiable reason! Is it that the glorified souls, the saints,
are equal to God, being predestined to good, and deprived
of what is called <em>free will</em>, which, according to Saint Augustine,
is only the possibility of evil when the divine grace
does not incline man towards the
good?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_642" id="fnanchor_642"></a><a href="#footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></span></p>

<p>Bayle, after several outbursts of this sort, finishes by
declaring that the way in which evil is introduced under the
rule of a sovereign being, infinitely good, infinitely potential,
infinitely holy, is not only inexplicable but even
incomprehensible.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_643" id="fnanchor_643"></a><a href="#footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></span>
Bayle is right on this point; also I have always
said, in the course of this work, that the origin of evil,
comprehensible or not, could never be divulged. But the
matter of the origin of evil is not the question here. Bayle
was too good a reasoner not to have felt it, not to have seen
that the argument of Epicurus, and all the elocution with
which he furnished it, did not bear upon the cause of evil
itself, but upon its effects; which is quite different. Epicurus
did not demand that the origin of evil be explained to him,
but the local existence of its effects&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, one should
state clearly to him, that if God was able and willing to take
away the evil from the world, or to prevent it from penetrating
there, why he did not do so. When any one’s house
is the prey of flames, one is not so insensate as to be concerned
with knowing what the essence of the fire is, and why it burns
in general, but why it burns in particular; and why, being
able to extinguish it, one has not done so. Bayle, I repeat,
was too clever a logician not to have perceived this. This
distinction was too simple to have escaped him; but seeing
that its very simplicity had concealed it from the doctors
of the Christian church, he was content to affect an ignorance
of it to his adversaries, to have the pleasure, so precious to a
skeptic such as he, of seeing them one after another exhaust
themselves upon the argument of Epicurus:</p>

<p class="blockquote">God, whether he wills to take away evil, and can not; whether
he can and does not will to; whether he does not will it nor can;
whether he wills it and can. If he wills it and can not, he is
weak; which does not accord with God. If he can and does not
will it, he is wicked; which accords with him no better. If he
does not will it nor can, he is wicked and weak, which could not
be. If he can and wills it, that which alone is worthy of his
divinity, whence then come the evils? Or why does he not take
them away?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_644" id="fnanchor_644"></a><a href="#footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>Lactantius, to whom Bayle owed his argument, had
thought to overthrow it, by saying that God, being able to
take away evil, did not will it; so as to give to men, by its
means, wisdom and virtue.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_645" id="fnanchor_645"></a><a href="#footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></span>
But the skeptic philosopher
had no trouble to prove that this answer was worth nothing,
and that the doctrine that it contained was monstrous; since
it was certain that God was able to give wisdom and virtue
without the means of evil; since he had even given them,
following the belief of Lactantius himself, and that it was
because he had renounced them that man had become subject
to evil. Saint Basil was no more fortunate than Lactantius.
Vainly he asserted that the free will, whence results
evil, had been established by God himself in the design that
this All-powerful Being had for being loved and freely served.
Bayle, attacking him in his own faith, asked him, if God is
loved and served by force in Paradise, where the glorified
souls do not enjoy the fatal privilege of being able to
sin.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_646" id="fnanchor_646"></a><a href="#footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></span>
And with the same blow with which he struck him, he
brought down Malebranche who had said the same
thing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_647" id="fnanchor_647"></a><a href="#footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></span>

The downfall of Malebranche, and the desire to avenge him,
bestirred in vain a crowd of audacious metaphysicians.
Bayle pierced them one after another with the weapons of
Epicurus, whose steel they did not know, and died with the
glory of their having said the greatest piece of stupidity
which could be said upon a like matter: namely, that it was
possible that God might prescribe another end, in creating
the world, than to make his creatures
happy.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_648" id="fnanchor_648"></a><a href="#footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Bayle did not extinguish the ardour that his
works had excited. Leibnitz, justly displeased with all that
had been said, thought he could answer the skeptic philosopher
better; and raising himself with a great force of genius
to that pristine moment when God formed the decree of
producing the world, he represented the Being of beings
choosing among an infinity of worlds, all possible, all present
at his thought, the actual world, as most conformable to his
attributes, the most worthy of him, the best finally, the most
capable of attaining to the greatest and most excellent end
that this all-perfect Being may have been able to
purpose.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_649" id="fnanchor_649"></a><a href="#footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></span>
But what is this magnificent and worthy end which the
Divinity has chosen, this goal which not alone constitutes
the actual world such as it is, but which also presents it to
the mind, according to the system of Leibnitz, as the best of
possible worlds? This philosopher does not know.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We are not able [he said] to penetrate it, for we are too
limited for this; we can only infer, by reasoning with the insight
that God has given us, that his bounty only has been able to
purpose, by creating the greatest possible number of intelligent
creatures, by endowing them with as much knowledge, happiness,
and beauty as the Universe might admit without going away
from the immutable order established by his
wisdom.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_650" id="fnanchor_650"></a><a href="#footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to this point, the system of Leibnitz sustained itself,
and was able even to lead to a relative truth; but its work
was not accomplished. It was necessary to explain, following
the demand of Epicurus so much repeated by Bayle, how
in this immutable order established by the divine Wisdom
in this best of worlds, that physical and moral evil make felt
such severe effects. The German philosopher, instead of
stopping at these effects, and stating the primordial cause,
inaccessible to his researches, still scorned it, as had all the
adversaries of Bayle, and asserted that physical and moral
evils were necessary to maintain this immutable order, and
entered into the plan of this best of worlds. Fatal assertion
which overthrew his system instantly: for, how dares one
to say that evil is necessary, and above all necessary not
only in what is best, but in what is the best possible!</p>

<p>Now, whatever may be the primordial cause of Evil,
concerning which I can not nor do I wish to explain myself,
until the triple veil, extended over this formidable mystery
by Moses, may have been raised, I will say, according to the
doctrine of Pythagoras and Plato, that its effects can be
neither necessary, nor irresistible since they are not immutable
and I will reply to the much-lauded argument of Epicurus,
that by this very thing they are neither necessary nor
irresistible; God can and will remove them and he does
remove them.</p>

<p>And if certain disciples of Bayle, astonished by a reply
so bold and so new, asked me when and how God works so
great a benefit, of which they have perceived no traces, I
will say to them: by time and by means of perfectibility.
Time is the instrument of Providence; perfectibility, the
plan of its work; Nature, the object of its labour; and Good,
its result. You know, and Bayle himself agrees, that there
exists a mixture of good and evil: and I repeat to you here
what I have already said<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_651" id="fnanchor_651"></a><a href="#footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></span>;
and I maintain that this good
emanates from Providence, and is its work, and replaces in
the sphere where it has been transported, an equivalent
amount of evil which it has transmuted into good; I maintain
that this good continues augmenting itself unceasingly
and the evil which corresponds to it, diminishing in an equal
proportion; I maintain finally that, having left absolute evil
and having arrived at the point where you now are, you will
arrive by the same road and by the same means, that is, by
favour of time and of perfectibility, from the point where
you are to absolute Good, the crown of perfection. This is
the answer to your question, When and how does God take
away evils? Still if you claim you cannot see any of this,
I will reply that it is not for you, arguing with the weakness
of your view, to deny the progress of Providence, you whose
imperfect senses mistake all the time even the subjects
within your range, and for whom the extremes are touching
so forcibly, that it is impossible for you to distinguish upon
the same dial the movement of the needle which traverses
it in a cycle, from the movement of that which traverses
it in less than a second; one of these needles appearing to
you immobile and the other not existing for
you.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_652" id="fnanchor_652"></a><a href="#footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>If you deny what I affirm, bring other proofs of your
denial than your weakness and cease, from the little corner
where Nature has placed you, presuming to judge its immensity.
Still if you lack negative proofs, wait a moment
more, and you shall have from me affirmative proofs. But
if, going back, and wishing to sustain the argument of Epicurus
which is giving way, you believe that you will succeed
by saying that this philosopher had not asked, in the case
where God was able and willed to remove evils, how he
removed them, but why he did not remove them; I will reply
to you that this question is a pure sophism; that the how is
implicitly contained in the why, to which I have replied in
affirming that God, being able and willing to remove evils,
removes them. And if you recall an objection that I have
already overthrown concerning the manner in which he
removes them, and that bringing you to judge of his ways,
you would assume that he ought to remove them, not in a
lapse of time so long that you would be unconscious of it,
but in the twinkling of an eye; I would reply that this way
would be to you quite as imperceptible as the other; and
that furthermore, that which you demand exists, since the
lapse of time of which you complain, however long it may
appear to you, is less than the twinkling of an eye for the
Being of beings who employs it, being absolutely <i>nihil</i>
compared to Eternity. And from there I will take occasion
to tell you that evil, in the way in which it is manifest in the
world, being a sort of malady, God, who alone can cure it,
knows also the sole remedy which may be applicable to it
and that this sole remedy is time.</p>

<p>It seems to me that however little attention you may
have given to what I have just said, you ought to be tempted
to pass on from the knowledge of the remedy to that of the
malady; but it is in vain that you would demand of me an
explanation concerning its nature. This explanation is not
necessary to overthrow the argument of Epicurus and that
is all that I have wished to do. The rest depends upon you
and I can only repeat with Lysis:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“God! Thou couldst save them by opening their eyes.”</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">34. <i>But no: ’tis for the humans of a race divine,<br />
            &ensp;To discern Error, and to see the Truth.</i></p>

<p>Hierocles who, as I have said, has not concealed the
difficulty which is contained in these lines, has raised it, by
making evident that it depends upon the free will of man, and
by putting a limit upon the evils which he attracts to himself
by his own choice. His reasoning coinciding with mine can
be reduced to these few words. The sole remedy for evil,
whatever may be the cause, is time. Providence, minister
of the Most High, employs this remedy; and by means of
perfectibility which results from it, brings back all to good.
But the aptitude of the maladies for receiving it acts in
proportion to this remedy. Time, always the same, and
always <i>nihil</i> for the Divinity is, however, shortened or
lengthened for men, according as their will coincides with the
providential action or differs therefrom. They have only to
desire good, and time which fatigues them will be lightened.
But what if they desire evil always, will time therefore not
be finished? Will the evils therefore have no limit? Is it
that the will of man is so inflexible that God may not turn it
towards the good? The will of man is free beyond doubt; and
its essence, immutable as the Divinity whence it emanates,
knows not how to be changed, but nothing is impossible for
God. The change which is effected in it, without which its
immutability may in no wise be altered, is the miracle of the
All-Powerful. It is a result of its own liberty, and if I dare
to say it, takes place by the coincidence of two movements,
whose impulse is given by Providence; by the first, it shows
to the will, goodness; by the second, it puts it in a fitting
position to meet this same goodness.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging">35. <i>Nature serves them.…</i></p>

<p>Lysis expresses it thus: Nature, by the homogeneity
which, as I have stated, constitutes its essence, teaches men
to see beyond the range of their senses, transports them by
analogy from one region to another and develops their ideas.
The perfectibility which is manifested through the grace of
time is called perfection; for the more a thing is perfected
the more perfect it becomes. The man who perceives this is
struck by it, and if he reflect he finds truth, as I have openly
stated, and to which Lysis was content with making allusion,
on account of the secret of the mysteries that he was forced
to respect.</p>

<p>It is this perfectibility manifested in Nature, which gives
the affirmative proofs that I have promised, touching the
way in which Providence removes with time the evils which
afflict men. These are the proofs <i>de facto</i>. They cannot be
challenged without absurdity. I know well that there have
been men who, studying Nature within four walls, and
considering its operations through the extremely narrow
prism of their ideas, have denied that anything might be
perfectible, and have asserted that the Universe was immobile
because they have not seen it move; but there does
not exist today a genuine observer, a naturalist whose learning
is founded upon Nature, who does not invalidate the
decision of these pretended savants, and who does not put
perfectibility in the rank of the most rigorously demonstrated
truths.</p>

<p>I shall not quote the ancients on a subject where their
authority would be challenged; I shall even limit myself, to
evade prolixities, to a small number of striking passages
among the moderns. Leibnitz, who ought less than any
other to admit perfectibility, since he had founded his system
upon the existence of the best of worlds possible, has, however,
recognized it in Nature, in advancing that all the
changes which are operated there are the consequence of
both; that everything tends toward its improvement, and
that therefore the present is already teeming with the
future.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_653" id="fnanchor_653"></a><a href="#footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></span>
Buffon, inclining strongly toward the system of atoms,
ought also to be much opposed, and yet he has been unable
to see that Nature, in general, tends far more toward life
than toward death, and that it seems to be seeking to
organize bodies as much as is
possible.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_654" id="fnanchor_654"></a><a href="#footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></span>
The school of
Kant has pushed the system of perfectibility as far as it
could go. Schelling, the disciple of most consequence of
this celebrated man, has followed the development of Nature
with a force of thought which has perhaps passed the mark.
The former, has ventured to say that Nature is a sort of
Divinity in germ, which tends to apotheosis, and is prepared
for existence with God, by the reign of Chaos, and by that
of Providence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_655" id="fnanchor_655"></a><a href="#footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></span>
But those are only speculative opinions.
Here are opinions founded upon facts.</p>

<p>As soon as one considers the Earth observingly, the
naturalists say, one perceives striking traces of the revolutions

<p class="blockquote">Besides [these same naturalists continue], the greater part
of the fossil bones that have been assembled and compared are
those of animals different from any of the species actually known;
has the kingdom of life therefore changed? This one cannot
refuse to believe.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_659" id="fnanchor_659"></a><a href="#footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></span>
As Nature proceeds unceasingly from the
simple to the composite, it is probable that the most imperfect
animals should have been created before the tribes, higher in
the scale of life. It even seems that each of the animal classes
indicates a sort of suspension in the creative power, an intermission,
an era of repose, during which Nature prepared in
silence the germs of life which should come to light in the course
of the cycles. One might thus enumerate the epochs of living
Nature, epochs remote in the night of ages and which have been
obliged to precede the formation of mankind. A time may have
been when the insect, the shell, the unclean reptile, did not
recognize the master in the Universe and were placed at the head
of the organized
bodies.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_660" id="fnanchor_660"></a><a href="#footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></span></p>

<p>These observers add:</p>

<p class="blockquote">It is certain that most perfect beings come from less perfect,
and that they are obliged to be perfected in the sequence of
generations. All animals tend towards man; all vegetables
aspire to animality; minerals seek to draw nearer to the vegetable.…
It is evident that Nature, having created a series of
plants and animals, and having stopped at man who forms the
superior extremity, has assembled in him all the vital faculties
that it had distributed among the inferior
races.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_661" id="fnanchor_661"></a><a href="#footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the ideas of Leibnitz. This celebrated man
had said: “Men hold to animals; these to plants, and those
to fossils. It is necessary that all the natural orders form
only one sole chain, in which the different classes hold strictly
as if they were its links.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_662" id="fnanchor_662"></a><a href="#footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></span>
Several philosophers have
adopted them,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_663" id="fnanchor_663"></a><a href="#footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></span>
but none have expressed them with more
order and energy than the author of the article <cite>Nature</cite>, in
<cite>Le Nouveau Dictionnaire d’Histoire naturelle</cite>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">All animals, all plants are only the modifications of an animal,
of a vegetable origin.… Man is the knot which unites the
Divinity to matter, which links heaven and earth. This ray
of wisdom and intelligence which shines in his thoughts is
reflected upon all Nature. It is the chain of communication
between all beings. All the series of animals [he adds in another
place] present only a long degradation from the proper
nature of man. The monkey, considered either in his exterior
form or in his interior organization, resembles only a degraded
man; and the same suggestion of degradation is observed in
passing from monkeys to quadrupeds; so that the primitive
trend of the organization is recognized in all, and the principal
viscera, the principal members are identical
there.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_664" id="fnanchor_664"></a><a href="#footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Who knows [observes elsewhere the same writer] who knows
if in the eternal night of time the sceptre of the world will not
pass from the hands of man into those of a being more worthy
of bearing it and more perfect? Perhaps the race of negroes,
today secondary in the human specie, has already been queen
of the earth before the white race was created.… If Nature
has successively accorded the empire to the species that it creates
more and more perfect, why should she cease today.… The
negro, already king of animals, has fallen beneath the yoke of
the European; will the latter bow the head in his turn before a
race more powerful and more intelligent when it enters into the
plans of Nature to ordain his existence? Where will his creation
stop? Who will place the limits of his power? God alone
raises it and it is His all-powerful hand which
governs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_665" id="fnanchor_665"></a><a href="#footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></span></p>

<p>These striking passages full of forceful ideas, which

<p>Lysis, speaking always in the name of Pythagoras, addressed
himself to those of the disciples of this theosophist,
who had reached the highest degree of perfection, or autopsy,
and the felicity of their welfare. I have said often enough in
the course of these Examinations, what should be understood
by this last degree, so that I need not refer to it here. I shall
not even pause upon what has reference to the symbolic
teachings of Pythagoras, the formularies and dietetics that
he gave to his disciples, and the abstinences that he prescribed
for them, my design being to give incidentally a
particular explanation of it, for the purpose of not further
prolonging this volume. It is well known that all of the
eminent men, as many among the ancients as among the
moderns, all the savants commendable for their labours or
their learning, are agreed in regarding the precepts of Pythagoras
as symbolical, that is, as containing figuratively,
a very different meaning from that which they would seem to
offer literally.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_666" id="fnanchor_666"></a><a href="#footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></span>
It was the custom of the Egyptian priests
from whom he had imbibed
them,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_667" id="fnanchor_667"></a><a href="#footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></span>
to conceal their doctrine
beneath an outer covering of parables and
allegories.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_668" id="fnanchor_668"></a><a href="#footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></span>
The world was, in their eyes, a vast enigma, whose mysteries,
clothed in a style equally enigmatical, ought never
to be openly divulged.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_669" id="fnanchor_669"></a><a href="#footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></span>
These priests had three kinds of
characters, and three ways of expressing and depicting their
thoughts. The first manner of writing and of speaking was
clear and simple; the second, figurative; and the third,
symbolic. In the first, they employed characters used by
all peoples and took the words in their literal meaning; in
the second, they used hieroglyphic characters, and took the
words in an indirect and metaphorical meaning; finally in
the third, they made use of phrases with double meaning
of historic and astronomical fables, or of simple
allegories.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_670" id="fnanchor_670"></a><a href="#footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></span>
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(chef-d’œuvre)</i> of the sacerdotal art was uniting these
three ways, and enclosing under the appearance of a clear
and simple style, the vulgar, figurative, and symbolic meaning.
Pythagoras has sought this kind of perfection in his
precepts and often he has succeeded; but the one of all the
theosophists instructed in the sanctuaries of Thebes or of
Memphis, who has pushed farthest, this marvellous art, is
beyond doubt Moses. The first part of his Sepher, vulgarly
called <cite>Genesis</cite>, and that should be called by its original name
of <cite>Bereshith</cite>, is in this style, the most admirable work, the
most astounding feat of strength that is possible for a man
to conceive and execute. This book, which contains all the
science of the ancient Egyptians, is still to be translated and
will only be translated when one will put oneself in a condition
to understand the language in which it has primitively
been composed.</p>

<p>Here, said Hierocles, in terminating his commentaries, is
the blissful end of all efforts: here, according to Plato, is the
hope which enkindles, which sustains the ardour of him who
fights in the career of virtue: here, the inestimable prize
which awaits him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_671" id="fnanchor_671"></a><a href="#footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></span>
It was the great object of the mysteries,

His soul purified by virtue, said Pindar, unfolds

It goes on, said Socrates, attracted by the celestial
element which has the greatest affinity with its nature, to
become united with the immortal Gods and to share their
glory and their
immortality.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_675" id="fnanchor_675"></a><a href="#footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></span>
This deification was, according
to Pythagoras, the work of divine love; it was
reserved for him who had acquired truth through his intellectual
faculties, virtue through his animistic faculties,
and purity through his instinctive faculties. This purity,
after the end of his material body, shone forth and made
itself known in the form of a luminous body, that the soul
had been given during its confinement in its gloomy body;
for as I finish these Examinations, I am seizing the only
occasion which may still be presented of saying that, this
philosopher taught that the soul has a body which is given
according to his good or bad nature, by the inner labour of
his faculties. He called this body the subtle chariot of the
soul, and said that the mortal body is only the gross exterior.
He adds, “The care of the soul and its luminous body is, in
practicing virtue, in embracing truth and abstaining from
all impure
things.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_676" id="fnanchor_676"></a><a href="#footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the veritable aim of the symbolic abstinences that
he prescribes, even as Lysis insinuates moreover quite
clearly in the lines which make the subject of my preceding
Examination, when he said that it is necessary to abstain
from the things which are injurious to the development of
the soul and to distinguish clearly these things.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Pythagoras believed that there existed
celestial goodness proportionate to each degree of virtue,
and that there is for the souls, different ranks according to
the luminous body with which they are clothed. The
supreme happiness, according to him, belongs only to the
soul which has learned how to recover itself, by its intimate
union with the intelligence, whose essence, changing its
nature, has become entirely spiritual. It is necessary that
this soul be raised to the knowledge of universal truths, and
that it should have found, as far as it is possible for it, the
Principle and the end of all things. Then having attained
to this high degree of perfection, being drawn into this immutable
region whose ethereal element is no more subjected
to the descending movement of generation, it can be united
by its knowledge to the Universal All, and reflect in all its
being the ineffable light with which the Being of beings, God
Himself, fills unceasingly the Immensity.</p>

 <dfn>Poetry</dfn>, in Greek ποίησις, derived from the Phœnician פאה (<dfn>phohe</dfn>), mouth,
voice, language, discourse; and from יש (<dfn>ish</dfn>), a superior being, a principle being,
figuratively God. This last word, spread throughout Europe, is found with certain
change of vowels and of aspirates, very common in the Oriental dialects; in
the Etruscan Æs, <dfn>Æsar</dfn>, in the Gallic Æs, in the Basque <dfn>As</dfn>, and in the Scandinavian
<dfn>Ase</dfn>; the Copts still say <dfn>Os</dfn>, the lord, and the Greeks have preserved it in

<p class="footnote"><dfn>Thrace</dfn>, in Greek θρᾴκη, derived from the Phœnician רקיע (<dfn>rakiwha</dfn>), which

<p class="footnote"><dfn>Olen</dfn>, in Greek ὤλεν, is derived from the Phœnician עולן (<dfn>whôlon</dfn>), and

as an interesting thing and but little known by mythologists, that it is from
the word אפ (<dfn>ab</dfn> or <dfn>ap</dfn>) joined to that of <dfn>whôlon</dfn>, that one formed <dfn>ap-whôlon</dfn>,
Apollon; namely, the Father universal, infinite, eternal. This is why the
invention of Poetry is attributed to Olen or to Apollo. It is the same mythological
personage represented by the sun. According to an ancient tradition,
Olen was native of Lycia, that is to say, of the light; for this is the meaning
of the Greek word λύκη.</p>

 The Greek word Θρᾴκη, Thrace, in passing into the Ionian dialect Θρῄξ,
has furnished the following expressions: θρῆσκος, a devotee, θρησκεία, devotion,
θρησκηύω, I adore with devotion. These words, diverted from their
real sense and used ironically after the cult of Thrace had yielded to that of
Delphi, were applied to ideas of superstition and even of fanaticism. The
point of considering the Thracians as schismatics was even reached, and the
word ἐθελοθρησκεία composed to express a heresy, a cult particular to those
who practised it, and separated from orthodoxy.</p>

 Œtolinos is composed, by contraction, of two words which appear to
belong to one of the Thracian dialects. <dfn>Œto-Kyros</dfn> signifies the ruling sun,
among the Scythians, according to Herodotus (l. iv., 59). <dfn>Helena</dfn> signified
the moon, among the Dorians. It is from this last word, deprived of its
article <dfn>he</dfn>, that the Latins have made <i>Luna</i>.</p>

 The commencement of the Indian Kali-youg is placed 3101 or 3102
years before our era. Fréret has fixed it, in his chronological researches, at
January 16, 3102, a half hour before the winter solstice, in the colure of which
was then found the first star of Aries. The Brahmans say that this age of
darkness and uncleanness must endure 432,000 years. <dfn>Kali</dfn> signifies in Sanskrit,
all that which is black, shadowy, material, bad. From there, the Latin
word <dfn>caligo</dfn>; and the French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(galimatias)</i>; the last part of this word comes
from the Greek word μῦθος, a discourse, which is itself derived from the
Phœnician מוט (<dfn>mot</dfn> or <dfn>myt</dfn>), which expresses all that moves, stirs up; a
motion, a word, etc.</p>

 <abbr title="Herodotus, livre 2">Herod., l. ii.</abbr> This historian said that in the early times all Egypt was
a morass, with the exception of the country of Thebes; that nothing was seen
of the land, which one saw there at the epoch in which he was writing, beyond
Lake Mœris; and that going up the river, during a seven days’ journey, all
seemed a vast sea. This same writer said in the beginning of book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, and
this is very remarkable, that the Phœnicians had entered from the Red Sea
into the Mediterranean, to establish themselves upon its shores, which they
would have been unable to do if the Isthmus of Suez had existed. See what
Aristotle says on this subject, <abbr title="Meteorologica, livre 1, chapter"><cite>Meteorolog.</cite>, l. i., c.</abbr> 14.</p>

established themselves upon the Persian Gulf and, under the name of Phœnicians,
came afterwards along the coast of Yemen, on the borders of the Red

to the Persian traditions. This coincidence is of great historical interest.</p>

 It is needless for me to observe that the birthplace of Homer has been
the object of a host of discussions as much among the ancients as among the
moderns. My plan here is not to put down again <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(en problème)</i>, nor to examine
anew the things which have been a hundred times discussed and that
I have sufficiently examined. I have chosen, from the midst of all the divergent
opinions born of these discussions, that which has appeared to me the
most probable, which agrees best with known facts, and which is connected
better with the analytical thread of my ideas. I advise my readers to do the
same. It is neither the birthplace of Homer nor the name of his parents that
is the important matter: it is his genius that must be fathomed. Those who
would, however, satisfy their curiosity regarding these subjects foreign to my
researches, will find in <cite>La Bibliothèque grecque de Fabricius</cite>, and in the book
by Léon Allatius entitled <cite>De Patriâ Homeri</cite>, enough material for all the systems
they may wish to build. They will find there twenty-six different locations
wherein they can, at their pleasure, place the cradle of the poet. The seven
most famous places indicated in a Greek verse by Aulus Gellius are, Smyrna,
Rhodes, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, and Athens. The nineteen indicated
by divers authors, are Pylos, Chios, Cyprus, Clazomenæ, Babylon,
Cumæ, Egypt, Italy, Crete, Ithaca, Mycenæ, Phrygia, Mæonia, Lucania,
Lydia, Syria, Thessaly, and finally Troy, and even Rome.</p>

<p class="footnote">However, the tradition which I have followed, in considering Homer as
born not far from Smyrna, upon the borders of the river Meles, is not only
the most probable but the most generally followed; it has in its favour Pindar;
the first anonymous Life of Homer; the Life of this poet by Proclus; Cicero,
in his oration for Archias; Eustathius in his <cite>Prolégoménes sur l’Iliade</cite>; Aristotle,
<cite>Poétique</cite>, <abbr title="livre 3">l. iii.</abbr>; Aulus Gellius, Martial, and Suidas. It is known that
Smyrna, jealous of consecrating the glory that it attributed to itself, of having
given birth to Homer, erected to this great genius a temple with quadrangular
portico, and showed for a long time, near the source of the Meles, a grotto,
where a contemporaneous tradition supposes that he had composed his first
works. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyez <cite>La Vie d’Homère</cite>, par Delille-de-Sales,

 In Phœnician מלך־אתע (<dfn>Melich-ærtz</dfn>), in Greek Μελικέρτης: a name given
to the Divinity whom the Thracians called <dfn>Hercules</dfn>, the Lord of the Universe:
from הרר or שרר (<dfn>harr</dfn> or <dfn>shar</dfn>), excellence, dominance, sovereignty; and כל (<dfn>col.</dfn>),
All. Notice that the Teutonic roots are not very different from the Phœnician:
<dfn>Herr</dfn> signifies lord, and <dfn>alles</dfn>, all; so that <dfn>Herr-alles</dfn> is, with the exception of the
guttural inflection which is effaced, the same word as that of <dfn>Hercules</dfn>, used
by the Thracians and the Etruscans. The Greeks have made a transposition
of letters in Ἡρακλῆς (<dfn>Heracles</dfn>) so as to evade the guttural harshness without
entirely losing it.</p>

 I have followed the tradition most analogous to the development of my
ideas; but I am aware that, upon this point, as upon many others, I have only
to choose. The historic fact, in that which relates to the sacerdotal archives
which Homer consulted in composing his poems, is everywhere the same <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(au
fond)</i>; but the accessory details vary greatly according to the writers who relate
them. For example, one reads in a small fragment attributed to Antipater
of Sidon and preserved in Greece Anthology, that Homer, born at Thebes
in Egypt, drew his epic subjects from the archives of the temple of Isis; from
another source, Ptolemy <cite>Ephestion</cite>, cited by Photius, that the Greek poet had
received from a priest of Memphis, named <span class="person">Thamitès</span>, the original writings of
an inspired damsel, named <span class="person">Phancy</span>. Strabo, without mentioning any place
in particular, said in general, speaking of the long journeys of Homer, that
this poet went everywhere to consult the religious archives and the oracles
preserved in the temples; and Diodorus of Sicily gives evidence sometimes
that he borrowed many things from a sibyl by the name of <span class="person">Manto</span>, daughter
of Tiresias; and sometimes that he appropriated the verse of a pythoness of
Delphi, named Daphne. All these contradictory details prove, in reality,
the truth; for whether it be from Thebes, Memphis, Tyre, Delphi, or elsewhere
that Homer drew the subject of his chants, matters not with the subject
which occupies me: the important point, serving as proof of my assertions, is,
that they have been, in fact, drawn from a sanctuary; and what has determined
me to choose Tyre rather than Thebes or Memphis, is that Tyre was
the first mother city of Greece.</p>

 I have said in the above that the name of <dfn>Helena</dfn> or <dfn>Selena</dfn> was that of
the moon in Greek. The root of this word is alike Celtic and Phœnician.
One finds it in Teutonic <dfn>hell</dfn>, which signifies clear, luminous, and in Hebrew הלל
(<dfn>hêll</dfn>), which contains the same sense of splendour, glory, and elevation. One
still says in German <dfn>heilig</dfn>, holy, and <dfn>selig</dfn>, blessed; also <dfn>selle</dfn>, soul, and <dfn>sellen</dfn>,
souls. And this is worthy of the closest attention, particularly when one
reflects that, following the doctrine of the ancients, the moon <dfn>helenê</dfn> or <dfn>selenê</dfn>
was regarded as the reservoir of the souls of those who descend from heaven
to pass into bodies by means of generation, and, purged by the fire of life,
escape from earth to ascend to heaven. See, concerning this doctrine, Plutarch
(<cite>De Facie in <abbr title="Orbe Lunae">Orb. Lun.</abbr></cite>), and confer
 with Beausobre (<cite>Histoire du <abbr title="Manichéisme">Manich.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="tome 2, page">t, ii., p.</abbr> 311). The name of <i>Paris</i>, in Greek Πάρις, comes from the Phœnician
words בר or פר (<dfn>bar</dfn> or <dfn>phar</dfn>), all generation, propagation, extension, and יש (<dfn>ish</dfn>),
the Being-principle.</p>

<p class="footnote">The name of <dfn>Menelaus</dfn>, in Greek Μενέλαος, comes from the Phœnician
words מן (<dfn>men</dfn>), all that which determines, regulates, or defines a thing,
properly, the <dfn>rational faculty</dfn>, the reason, the measure, in Latin <dfn>mens</dfn>, <dfn>mensura</dfn>;
and אוש (<dfn>aôsh</dfn>), the Being-principle acting, before which is placed the prefix ל (<dfn>l</dfn>),
to express the genitive case, in this manner, מנה־ל־אוש (<dfn>meneh-l-aôsh</dfn>),
the rational faculty or regulator of the being in general, and man in
particular: for אש&rlm;, &rlm;אוש&rlm;, &rlm;אש&rlm;, &rlm;איש (<dfn>ash</dfn>, <dfn>aôsh</dfn>,
<dfn>ish</dfn>, <dfn>aîsh</dfn>), signifies equally <dfn>fire</dfn>,
<dfn>principle</dfn>, <dfn>being</dfn>, and <dfn>man</dfn>. The etymology of these three words can, as one
sees, throw great light upon the fable of the <cite>Iliad</cite>. Here is another remarkable
point on this subject. Homer has never used, to designate the Greeks, the
name of <dfn>Hellenes</dfn>, that is to say, the respondents, or the lunars: it was in his
time quite a new name, which the confederated Greeks had taken to resist
foreign attack; it is only in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, and when he is already old, that he
employs the name <dfn>Hellas</dfn> to designate Greece. The name which he gives
constantly to this country, is that of Achaia (Ἀχαΐα), and he opposes it to
that of Troy (Τρωία): now, Achaia signifies the strong, the igneous, the
spiritual; and <dfn>Troy</dfn>, the terrestrial, the gross. The Phœnician roots are הוי (<dfn>ehôi</dfn>),
the exhaling force of fire, and טרו (<dfn>trô</dfn>) the balancing power of the
earth. Refer, in this regard, to Court de Gébelin
(<cite><abbr title="Monde primitif">Mond. prim.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="tome 6, page">t. vi., p.</abbr> 64).
Pomponius Sabinus, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commentaires sur l’Enéïde</cite>, said that the name
of the city of Troy signified a sow, and he adds that the Trojans had for an
ensign a sow embroidered in gold.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the word <dfn>Ilion</dfn>, which was the sacred name of Troy, it is very easy
to recognize the name of the material principle, called ὕλη (<dfn>ulè</dfn>) by the Greeks
and <dfn>ylis</dfn> by the Egyptians. Iamblichus speaks of it at great length in his
<cite>Book on the Mysteries</cite> (<abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 7), as the principle from which all has birth: this was
also the opinion of Porphyry (<abbr title="Eusebius, Præparatio evangelica, livre 9, chapters">Euseb.,

 The word <dfn>Epopœia</dfn> is taken from the Greek ἐπο-ποιός which designates
alike a poet and an epic poem. It is derived from the Phœnician words אפא
(<dfn>apho</dfn>) an impassioned transport, a vortex, an impulse, an enthusiasm; and פאה (<dfn>phohe</dfn>),
a mouth, a discourse. One can observe that the Latin word
<dfn>versus</dfn>, which is applied also to a thing which turns, which is borne along, and
to a poetic verse, translates exactly the Greek word ἔπος, whose root אוף
(<dfn>aôph</dfn>) expresses a <dfn>vortex</dfn>. The Hebrew אופן (<dfn>aôphon</dfn>) signifies properly a
<dfn>wheel</dfn>.</p>

 It can be seen that I have placed in the word Stesi[`c]horus, an <dfn>accent
grave</dfn> over the consonant <dfn>c</dfn>, and it will be noticed that I have used it thus
with respect to many similar words. It is a habit I have contracted in writing, so
as to distinguish, in this manner, the double consonant <dfn>ch</dfn>, in the foreign words,
or in their derivatives, when it should take the guttural inflexion, in place of
the hissing inflexion which we ordinarily give to it. Thus I accent the [<dfn>`c</dfn>] in
<dfn>Chio</dfn>, [<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hœur</dfn>, [<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>horus</dfn>, <dfn>é</dfn>[<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>ho</dfn>, [<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hlorose</dfn>,
 [<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hiragre</dfn>, [<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hronique</dfn>, etc.; to indicate that
these words should be pronounced <dfn>Khio</dfn>, <dfn>khœur</dfn>, <dfn>khorus</dfn>,
 <dfn>ékho</dfn>, <dfn>khlorose</dfn>, <dfn>khiragre</dfn>,
<dfn>khronique</dfn>, with the aspirate sound of <dfn>k</dfn>, and not with that of the hissing <dfn>c</dfn>,
as in <dfn>Chypre</dfn>, <dfn>chaume</dfn>, <dfn>échope</dfn>, <dfn>chaire</dfn>, etc.
 This accentuation has appeared to
me necessary, especially when one is obliged to transcribe in modern characters
many foreign words which, lacking usage, one knows not, at first, how to
pronounce. It is, after all, a slight innovation in orthography, which I leave
to the decision of the grammarians. I only say that it will be very difficult
for them, without this accent, or any other sign which might be used, to know
how one should pronounce with a different inflexion, <dfn>A</dfn>[<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>haïe</dfn> and <dfn>Achéen</dfn>;
<dfn>Achille</dfn> and <dfn>A</dfn>[<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hilleïde; Achêron</dfn> and <dfn>a</dfn>[<dfn>`c</dfn>]<dfn>hérontique</dfn>;

 The name of Homeridæ, given at first to all the disciples of Homer, was
afterwards usurped by certain inhabitants of Chios who called themselves
his descendants (<abbr title="Strabo, livre 14">Strab., l. xiv.</abbr>; <abbr title="Isocrates">Isocr.</abbr>,
 <cite>Hellen. encom.</cite>). Also I should state
here that the name of Homer, Ὅμηρος, was never of Greek origin and has
not signified, as has been said, <em>blind</em>. The initial letter O is not a negation,
but an article added to the Phœnician word מרא (<dfn>mœra</dfn>), which signifies,
properly speaking, a centre of light, and figuratively, a master, a doctor.</p>

 The surname Eumolpidæ, given to the hierophants, successors of Orpheus,
comes from the word Εὔμολπος, by which is designated the style of
poetry of this divine man. It signifies <dfn>the perfect voice</dfn>. It is derived from
the Phœnician words מלא (<dfn>mola</dfn>), perfected, and פאה (<dfn>phoh</dfn>), mouth, voice,
discourse. The adverb ἔυ, which precedes it, expresses whatever is beautiful,
holy, perfect.</p>

 Rama is, in Sanskrit, the name of that which is dazzling, elevated, white,
sublime, protective, beautiful, excellent. This word has exactly the same sense
in the Phœnician רמ (<dfn>ram</dfn>). Its primitive root, which is universalized by
the <dfn>hémantique</dfn> letter מ (<dfn>m</dfn>), is רא (<dfn>ra</dfn>), which has
 reference to the harmonic
movement of good, of light, and of sight. The name of the adversary of
Rama, <dfn>Rawhan</dfn>, is formed from the root רע (<dfn>rawh</dfn>) which expresses, on the
contrary, the disordered movement of evil and of fire, and which, becoming
united with the augmentative syllable ון (<dfn>ôn</dfn>), depicts whatever ravages and
ruins; this is the signification which it has in Sanskrit.</p>

 From the word רמא (<dfn>rama</dfn>) is formed in Phœnician the word דרמא
(<dfn>drama</dfn>) by the adjunction of the demonstrative article ד (<dfn>d’</dfn>); that is to say,
a thing which comes from Rama: an action well ordered, beautiful, sublime,
etc. Notice that the Greek verb δραεῖν, <dfn>to act</dfn>, whence is drawn very inappropriately
the word δρᾶμα, is always attached to the same root רא (<dfn>ra</dfn>)
which is that of harmonic movement.</p>

by metaphor, because of the roughness and heights which this animal loves
to climb; as <dfn>caper</dfn>, in Latin, holds to the same root as <dfn>caput</dfn>; and <dfn>chèvre</dfn>, in
French, to the same root as <dfn>chef</dfn>, for a similar reason.</p>

 The proof that Rome was scarcely known in Greece, at the epoch of
Alexander, is that the historian Theopompus, accused by all critics of too
much prolixity, has said only a single word concerning this city, to announce
that she had been taken by the Gauls (Pliny, <abbr title="livre 3, chapter">l. iii., c.</abbr> 5). Bayle observes
with much sagacity, that however little Rome had been known at that
time, she would not have failed to furnish the subject of a long digression
for this historian, who would have delighted much in it. (<abbr title="Dictionnaire Critique, article"><cite>Dict. crit.</cite>, art.</abbr>

 The real founder of the Atomic system such as has been adopted by
Lucretius (<cite>De Rerum Natura</cite>, <abbr title="livre 1">l. i.</abbr>), was Moschus, Phœnician philosopher
whose works threw light upon those of Leucippus (Posidonius cité par Strabon,
<abbr title="livre 16">l. xvi.</abbr>, <abbr title="Sextus Empiricus, Adversos Mathematicos, page">Sext. Empiric.,
 <cite>Adv. mathem.</cite>, p.</abbr> 367). This system well understood,
does not differ from that of the monads, of which Leibnitz was the inventor.</p>

 Voltaire, who has adopted this error, has founded it upon the signification
of the word <dfn>Epos</dfn>, which he has connected with that of Discourse (<cite><abbr title="Dictionnaire philosophique">Dictionn.
philos.</abbr></cite> au mot <span class="sc">Epopée</span>). But he is mistaken. The Greek word ἔπος
is translated accurately by <dfn>versus</dfn>. Thence the verb επεῖν, to follow in the
tracks, to turn, to go, in the same sense.</p>

 The Greeks looked upon the Latin authors and artists as paupers enriched
by their spoils; also they learned their language only when forced to do
so. The most celebrated writers by whom Rome was glorified, were rarely
cited by them. Longinus, who took an example of the sublime in Moses,
did not seek a single one either in Horace or in Vergil; he did not even mention
their names. It was the same with other critics. Plutarch spoke of Cicero
as a statesman; he quoted many of his clever sayings, but he refrained from
comparing him with Demosthenes as an orator. He excuses himself on account
of having so little knowledge of the Latin tongue, he who had lived so
long in Rome! Emperor Julian, who has written only in Greek, cites only
Greek authors and not one Latin.</p>

 This Ballad tongue, or rather Romance, was a mixture of corrupt Latin,
Teutonic, and ancient Gallic. It was called thus, in order to distinguish it
from the pure Latin and French. The principal dialects of the Romance
tongue were the <dfn>langue d’oc</dfn>, spoken in the south of France, and the <dfn>longue d’oïl</dfn>,
spoken in the north. It is from the <dfn>langue d’oïl</dfn> that the French descend.
The <dfn>langue d’oc</dfn>, prevailing with the troubadours who cultivated it, disappeared
with them in the fourteenth century and was lost in numberless obscure
provincial dialects. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyez <cite>(Le Troubadour)</cite>, poésies occitaniques, à la Dissert.,

 It is necessary to observe that <dfn>vau</dfn> or <dfn>val</dfn>, <dfn>bau</dfn> or <dfn>bal</dfn>, according to the
dialect, signifies equally a dance, a ball, and a folly, a fool. The Phœnician,
root רע (<dfn>whal</dfn>) expresses all that is elevated, exalted. The French words <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><dfn>(bal)</dfn>,
<dfn>vol</dfn>, <dfn>fol</dfn></span>, are here derived.</p>

 The sonnets are of Oscan origin. The word <dfn>son</dfn> signifies a song in the

<p class="footnote">The sylves, called <dfn>sirves</dfn> or <dfn>sirventes</dfn> by the troubadours, were kinds of

 Perhaps one is astonished to see that I give the name of <dfn>sirventes</dfn>, or
sylves, to that which is commonly called the poems of Dante; but in order to
understand me, it is necessary to consider that these poems, composed
of stanzas of three verses joined in couplets, are properly only long songs on a
serious subject, which agrees with the <dfn>sirvente</dfn>. The poems of Bojardo, of
Ariosto, of Tasso, are, as to form, only long ballads. They are poems because
of the unity which, notwithstanding the innumerable episodes with which
they are filled, constitutes the principal subject.</p>

 It must be remarked that the word <dfn>Diw</dfn>, which is also Persian, was alike
applied in Persia to the Divine Intelligence, before Zoroaster had changed
the signification of it by the establishment of a new doctrine, which, replacing
the <dfn>Diws</dfn> by the <dfn>Iseds</dfn>, deprived them of the dominion of Heaven, and represented
them as demons of the earth. See Anquetil Duperron, <cite>Vendidad-Sadè</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 133, <cite>Boun-Dehesh.</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 355. It is thus that Christianity has changed
the sense of the Greek word Δαίμων (Demon), and rendered it synonymous
with the devil; whereas it signified in its principle, divine spirit and genius.</p>

 It was said long ago that a great number of rhymed verses were found in
the Bible, and Voltaire even has cited a ridiculous example in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire
philosophique</cite> (<abbr title="article">art.</abbr> <span class="sc">Rime</span>):
but it seems to me that before concerning oneself
so much as one still does, whether the Hebraic text of the <cite>Sepher</cite> is in prose or
in verse, whether or not one finds there rhymed verses after the manner of
the Arabs, or measured after the manner of the Greeks, it would be well to
observe whether one understands this text. The language of Moses has been
lost entirely for more than two thousand four hundred years, and unless it
be restored with an aptitude, force, and constancy which is nowadays unusual,
I doubt whether it will be known exactly what the legislator of the Hebrews
has said regarding the principles of the Universe, the origin of the earth, and
the birth and vicissitudes of the beings who people it. These subjects are,
however, worth the pains if one would reflect upon them; I cannot prevent
myself from thinking that it would be more fitting to be occupied with the
meaning of the words, than their arrangements by long and short syllables,
by regular or alternate rhymes, which is of no importance whatever.</p>

 Nearly all of the Italian words terminate with one of four vowels, <dfn>a</dfn>, <dfn>e</dfn>, <dfn>i</dfn>, <dfn>o</dfn>,
without accent: it is very rare that the vowels are accentuated, as the vowel
<dfn>ù</dfn>. When this occurs as in <dfn>cità</dfn>, <dfn>perchè</dfn>, <dfn>dì</dfn>, <dfn>farò</dfn>, etc., then, only, is the final
masculine. Now here is what one of their best rhythmic poets, named Tolomèo,
gives as an hexameter verse:</p>

<p class="footnote">To make this line exact, one feels that the word <dfn>mando</dfn>, which terminates it,
should be composed of two longs, that is to say, that it should be written
<dfn>mandò</dfn>, which could not be without altering the sense entirely. Marchetti
has translated into blank verse the Latin poem of Lucretius. I will quote the
opening lines. Here is evident the softness to which I take exception and
which prevents them from being really eumolpique, according to the sense
that I have attached to this word.</p>

 One must not believe that the mute <dfn>e</dfn> with which many English words
terminate represents the French feminine final, expressed by the same vowel.
This mute <dfn>e</dfn> is in reality mute in English; ordinarily it is only used to give a
more open sound to the vowel which precedes it, as in <dfn>tale</dfn>, <dfn>scene</dfn>, <dfn>bone</dfn>, <dfn>pure</dfn>,
<dfn>fire</dfn>. Besides it is never taken into account, either in the measure or in the
prosody of the lines. Thus these two lines of Dryden rhyme exactly:</p>

 There remains to us of this poetry the very precious fragments contained
in the <cite>Edda</cite> and in <cite>Voluspa</cite>. The <cite>Edda</cite>, whose name signifies great-grandmother,
is a collection, fairly ample, of Scandinavian traditions. <cite>Voluspa</cite> is
a sort of Sibylline book, or cosmogonic oracle, as its name indicates. I am
convinced that if the poets of the north, the Danes, Swedes, and Germans,
had oftener drawn their subjects from these indigenous sources, they would
have succeeded better than by going to Greece to seek them upon the summits
of Parnassus. The mythology of Odin, descended from the Rhipæan mountains,
suits them better than that of the Greeks, whose tongue furthermore is
not conformable here. When one makes the moon and the wife (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><dfn>der Mond</dfn>,
<dfn>das Weib</dfn></span>) of masculine and neuter gender; when one makes the sun, the air,
time, love (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><dfn>die Sonne</dfn>, <dfn>die Luft</dfn>, <dfn>die Zeit</dfn>,
 <dfn>die Liebe</dfn></span>) of feminine gender, one
ought wisely to renounce the allegories of Parnassus. It was on account of
the sex given to the sun and the moon that the schism arose, of which I have
spoken, in explaining the origin of the temple of Delphi.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Scandinavian allegories, however, that I consider a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of Thracian
allegories, furnishing subjects of a very different character from those of the
Greeks and Latins, might have varied the poetry of Europe and prevented
the Arabesque fiction from holding there so much ascendancy. The Scandinavian
verses, being without rhyme, hold moreover, to eumolpœia. The
following is a strophe from <cite>Voluspa</cite>:</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the Gallic poetry of the Scotch bards, that Macpherson has made
known to us under the name of <cite>Ossian</cite>, much is needed that they may have a
sufficient degree of authenticity for them to be cited as models, and placed
parallel with those of Homer, as has been done without reflection. These
poems, although resting for the greater part upon a true basis, are very far
from being veritable as to form. The Scotch bards, like the Oscan troubadours,
must be restored and often entirely remade, if they are to be read.
Macpherson, in composing his <cite>Ossian</cite>, has followed certain ancient traditions,
has put together certain scattered fragments; but has taken great liberties
with all the rest. He was, besides, a man endowed with creative genius and
he might have been able to attain to epopœia if he had been better informed.
His lack of knowledge has left a void in his work which demonstrates its
falsity. There is no mythology, no allegory, no cult in <cite>Ossian</cite>. There are
some historic or romanesque facts joined to long descriptions; it is a style
more emphatic than figurative, more bizarre than original. Macpherson,
in neglecting all kinds of mythological and religious ideas, in even mocking
here and there the <em>stone of power</em> of the Scandinavians, has shown that he
was ignorant of two important things: the one, that the allegorical or religious
genius constitutes the essence of poetry; the other, that Scotland was at a
very ancient period the hearth of this same genius whose interpreters were
the druids, bards, and scalds. He should have known that, far from being
without religion, the Caledonians possessed in the heart of their mountains,
the Gallic Parnassus, the sacred mountain of the Occidental isles; and that
when the antique cult began to decline in Gaul, it was in Albion, reckoned
among the holy isles by even the Indians, that the druids went to study.

only one I believe, which is found in his poems; because Macpherson, for more
originality, neglected nearly always to announce the subject of his songs.
I will not give the text, because the English translation whence I obtained it
does not give it. It concerns the battle of Lora. After a kind of exordium

 The tragedy of the <cite>Cid</cite>, given by Pierre Corneille in 1626, upon which
were based the grandeur and dominant character of the Théâtre Français,
as well as the renown of the author, is taken from a Spanish ballad very celebrated
in Spain. The Cid, who is the hero of it, lived towards the close of the
eleventh century. He was a type of the paladins and knights errant of the
romanesque traditions. He enjoyed a wide reputation and attained a high
degree of fortune. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Voyez</i> Monte-Mayor, <cite>Diana</cite>,
 <abbr title="livre 2">l. ii.</abbr>; et Voltaire, <cite>Essai sur
les Mœurs</cite>, <abbr title="tome 3">t. iii.</abbr>, stéréotype, <abbr title="age">p.</abbr> 86.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">In the course of the sixteenth century, the Spanish held a marked superiority
over the other peoples: their tongue was spoken at Paris, Vienna, Milan,
Turin. Their customs, their manners of thought and of writing, subjugated
the minds of the Italians, and from Charles <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> to the commencement of the
reign of Philip <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, Spain enjoyed an importance that the other peoples never
had. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Voyez</i> Robertson, <cite>Introduction à l’Histoire de Charles-Quint</cite>.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">It would be necessary to overstep considerably the ordinary limits of a
footnote, if I should explain how it happens that Spain has lost this supremacy
acquired by her, and why her tongue, the only one capable of rivalling and
perhaps effacing the French, has yielded to it in all ways, and by which it was
eclipsed. This explanation would demand for itself alone a very lengthy
work. Among the writers who have sought for the cause of the decadence
of the Spanish monarchy, some have believed to discover it in the increase of
its wealth, others, in the too great extent of its colonies, and the greater part,
in the spirit of its government and its superstitious cult. They have all
thought that the tribunal of the Inquisition alone was capable of arresting the
impulse of genius and of stifling the development of learning. In this they
have taken effects for causes, and consequences for principles. They have
not seen that the spirit of the government and the cult is always not the motive,
but the result of the national spirit, and that the wealth and the colonies,
indifferent in themselves, are only instruments that this spirit employs for
good or evil, according to its character. I can only indicate the first cause
which has prevented Spain from reaching the culminating point which France
is very near to attaining. This cause is pride. Whilst Europe, enveloped
in darkness, was, so to speak, in the fermentation of ignorance, Spain, conquered
by the Arabs, received a germ of science which, developing with rapidity,
produced a precocious fruit, brilliant, but like hot-house fruit lacking
internal force and generative vigour. This premature production having
raised Spain abruptly above the other European nations, inspired in her that
pride, that excessive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</i>, which, making her treat with contempt
all that did not belong to her, hindered her from making any change in her
usual customs, carried her with complacency in her mistakes, and when other
peoples came to bring forth fruits in their season, corrupted hers and stamped
her with a stationary movement, which becoming necessarily retrogressive,
must ruin her, and did ruin her.</p>

 In comparing the first lines of Homer with those of Klopstock, it is seen
that the Greek contains 29 letters, 18 of which are vowels; and the German
48 letters, 31 of which are consonants. It is difficult with such disparity in
the elements to make the harmony the same.</p>

 The priests of the Burmans, called <dfn>Rahans</dfn>, but whose generic name is
that of <dfn>Sramana</dfn>, whence came to them that of Sramaneras, which the ancients
gave them, carry the spirit of tolerance as far as possible. They visit
with the same devotion pagodas, mosques, and churches; never does one see
them being persecuted, nor persecuting others in the cause of religion. The
Brahmans, Mussulmans, and Christians occupy important posts among them
without their being scandalized. They regard all men as brothers. (<abbr title="Asiatic Researches, tome 6, pages"><cite>Asiat.
Research.</cite>, t. vi., pp.</abbr> 274-279). The Brahmans are of the same mind. One
reads these wonderful words in the <cite>Bhaghavad Gita</cite>: “A great diversity of
cults, similar as to substance but varying in forms, are manifested by the will
of the Supreme Being. Some follow one cult, others attach themselves to
another: all of these worshippers are purified from their offences by their
particular cult.… God is the gift of charity, God is the offering, God
is the fire upon the altar; it is God even, who makes the sacrifice, and God will
be obtained by him who makes God the sole object of his labours.” (<cite>Lect.</cite> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr>)</p>

 The Greek word κόσμος expresses a thing put in order, arranged according
to a fixed and regular principle. Its primitive root is in the Phœnician אוש
(<dfn>aôsh</dfn>) a principle Being, <dfn>the fire</dfn>. The Latin word <dfn>mundus</dfn> renders the Greek
sense very imperfectly. It signifies exactly, that which is made neat and
clean by means of water. Its nearest root is <dfn>unda</dfn>, and its remotest root is
found in the Phœnician אוד (<dfn>aôd</dfn>), an emanation, a vapour, a source. One
can see, according to this etymology, that the Greeks drew the idea of order
and beauty from fire, and the Latins from water.</p>

 Pythagoras, at an early age, was taken to Tyre by Mnesarchus, his
father, in order to study there the doctrine of the Phœnicians; later he visited
Egypt, Arabia, and Babylon, in which last city he remained twelve years.
It was while there that he had frequent conferences concerning the principle
of things with a very learned magian whom Porphyry names Zabratos;
Plutarch, Zaratas; and Theodoret, Zaradas. (<abbr title="Porphyry, Vita Phythagoras">Porphyr., <cite>Vitâ Pythag.</cite></abbr>) Plutarch
is inclined to believe that this magian is the same as Zardusht, or Zoroaster,
and the chronology is not here entirely contrary.

 The word <dfn>Eon</dfn>, in Greek Αἰών, is derived from the Egyptian or Phœnician
אי (<dfn>aï</dfn>), a principle of will, a central point of development, and יון (<dfn>ion</dfn>),
the generative faculty. This last word has signified, in a restricted sense, a
dove, and has been the symbol of Venus. It is the famous <dfn>Yoni</dfn> of the Indians
and even the <dfn>Yn</dfn> of the Chinese: that is to say, the plastic nature of the Universe.
From there, the name of <dfn>Ionia</dfn>, given to Greece.</p>

 Gods, Heroes, and Demons signify in the Greek words Θεός, Ἥρωες,
Δαίμων, whence they are derived, the Principle-Beings attained to perfection;
the ruling Principle-Beings; Terrestrial Existences. The word Θεός is formed
from the word אוש (<dfn>aôs</dfn>), a Principle-Being, preceded by the <dfn>hemantique</dfn>
letter ת (θ, <dfn>th</dfn>), which is the sign of perfection. The word  Ἥρωες is composed
of the same word אוש (<dfn>aôs</dfn>), preceded by the word הרר (<dfn>herr</dfn>), expressing
all that rules. The word Δαίμων comes from the ancient word Δῆμ,
land, united with the word ὤν, existence.</p>

 Not long since, a man rather well organized mentally, but very slightly
enlightened by the true science, brought out a book entitled <cite>Ruverabhoni</cite>, in
which, heaping up all the ancient and modern sophisms pronounced against
the social organization founded upon the establishment of the family, he
aspired to change the instinct of nature, in this respect, and to found <em>true
happiness</em> upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of all the ties of blood, of all the affections of the
soul, and of all the duties of consanguinity.</p>

 <cite>This country of Adam</cite>, in Hebrew האדמה (<dfn>ha-adamah</dfn>), <dfn>adaméenne</dfn>.
This word, which has been vulgarly translated by <dfn>the Earth</dfn>, signifies it only
by metaphor. Its proper sense, which is very difficult to grasp, depends
always on that which is attached to the name of Adam, whence it is derived.
<dfn>Jhôah</dfn>, in Hebrew יהוה , pronounced very improperly <dfn>Jehovah</dfn>, on account of
a defective punctuation of the Masoretes, is the proper name of <span class="sc">God</span>. This
name was formed by Moses in a manner as ingenious as sublime, by means of
the contraction of the three tenses of the verb הוה (<dfn>hôeh</dfn>), to be. It signifies
exactly <dfn>will be-being-been</dfn>; that which is, was, and shall be. One renders
it well enough by <dfn>Eternal</dfn>. It is Eternity, or the Time-without-Limit of
Zoroaster. This name is quite generally followed, as it is here, with the words אלהיך
(<dfn>Ælohî-cha</dfn>), thy Gods, in order to express that the Unity contained in
Jhôah, comprehends the infinity of the gods, and takes the place of it with
the people of Israel.</p>

 When Zoroaster spoke of this Cause, he gave it the name of <cite>Time
without Limit</cite>, following the translation of Anquetil Duperron. This Cause
does not still appear absolute in the doctrine of this theosophist; because in a
passage of the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, where in contemplation of the Supreme Being,
producer of Ormuzd, he calls this Being, <i>the Being absorbed in excellence</i>,
and says that Fire, acting from the beginning, is the principle of union between
this Being and Ormuzd (36ᵉ <cite>hâ du Vendidad Sadé</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180,
 19ᵉ <cite>fargard</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 415).
One finds in another book, called <cite>Sharistha</cite>, that when this Supreme Being
organized the matter of the Universe, he projected his Will in the form of a
resplendent light (<i>Apud</i> Hyde, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 22, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 298).</p>

 The name given to the sect of the Pharisees signifies, in general, that
which is enlightened, illumined, glorified, illustrious. It is derived from the
root אור (<dfn>aor</dfn>), the light, governed by the article פה (<dfn>phe</dfn>), which expresses
the emphasis; thence פאר (<dfn>phær</dfn>), an aureola, a tiara, and פרתמים (<dfn>pharethmim</dfn>),
men illustrious, sublime. The name given to the sect of the Sadducees
is derived from the word שד (<dfn>shad</dfn>) which, expressing all diffusion,
all propagation, is applied to productive nature in general, and in particular
to a mammal, its symbol among the Egyptians; it signifies properly the
Physicists, or the Naturalists.</p>

 Pan, in Greek πᾶν, signifies the All, and Phanes is derived from the
Phœnician word אנש (<dfn>ânesh</dfn>), man, preceded by the emphatic article פ (<dfn>ph</dfn>).
It must be observed that these two names spring from the same root אן (<dfn>ân</dfn>),

 The name of <dfn>Pagan</dfn> is an injurious and ignoble term derived from the
Latin <dfn>Paganus</dfn>, which signifies a rustic, a peasant. When Christianity had
entirely triumphed over Greek and Roman polytheism, and when by the order
of the Emperor Theodosius, the last temple dedicated to the gods of the
nations had been destroyed in the cities, it was found that the people in the
country still persisted a considerable time in the ancient cult, which caused
them and all their imitators to be called derisively <dfn>Pagans</dfn>. This appellation,
which could suit the Greeks and Romans in the fifth century who refused to
submit to the dominating religion in the Empire, is false and ridiculous when
one extends it to other times, and to other peoples. It cannot be said without
at once offending chronology and common sense, that the Romans or Greeks
of the time of Cæsar, of Alexander, or of Pericles; the Persians, Arabs, Egyptians,
Indians, the Chinese, ancient or modern, were <dfn>Pagans</dfn>; that is to say,
peasants disobedient to the laws of Theodosius. These are polytheists, monotheists,
mythologists, whatever one wishes, idolaters perhaps, but not <dfn>Pagans</dfn>.</p>

exists; all the rest is <dfn>maya</dfn>, that is to say, phenomenal, even the trinity
formed by Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra.</p>

 Zeno having been thrown by a storm into the port of Piræus at Athens,
all his life regarded this accident as a blessing from Providence, which had
enabled him to devote himself to philosophy and to obey the voice of an
oracle which had ordered him to assume “the colour of the dead”; that is,
to devote himself to the study of the ancients and to sustain their doctrine.</p>

 The nearest root of this word is <dfn>find</dfn>, whence is derived <dfn>finden</dfn>, to find;
its remote root is <dfn>hand</dfn>, the seat of touch, whence comes <dfn>finger</dfn>, that which
feels; its primitive root is אד or יד (<dfn>âd</dfn> or <dfn>id</dfn>), the hand in Phœnician. This
last root, becoming nasal at the final and aspirate at the initial, has produced
<dfn>hand</dfn>; <dfn>fang</dfn>, a capture, and <dfn>find</dfn>, a discovery. The syllable <dfn>emp</dfn>, which precedes
the root <dfn>find</dfn>, expresses the movement which lifts up from below; <dfn>lich</dfn> designates
that which disqualifies by identity, and <dfn>keit</dfn>, that which substantiates.</p>

 The root of this word is <dfn>stand</dfn>, a fixed thing, a state; its remote root is
<dfn>stat</dfn>, that which is permanent. Its primitive root is שדד (<dfn>shdad</dfn>), firmness,
force, constancy. The initial syllable <dfn>ver</dfn> expresses the movement which
carries far away, which transports from the place where one is, to that where
one is not.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_511"><span class="muchsmaller">[511]</span></a>
 The nearest root of this word, as well as its remote root, has disappeared
from the modern German, where one finds only its derivatives. Its primitive
root is in the Latin word <dfn>opt</dfn>, whence comes <dfn>opto</dfn>, I choose: and <dfn>optime</dfn>, best.
This root is attached to the Phœnician עיף (<dfn>whôph</dfn>), anything which is raised
above another thing. It becomes nasal in the German word and has changed
the <dfn>ph</dfn> to <dfn>ft</dfn>. From it is derived the Saxon, English, Belgian, and Danish word
<dfn>up</dfn>, which expresses the movement of everything which tends above. Also
from it, the German word <dfn>luft</dfn>, air, and the English word <dfn>aloft</dfn>, that which is
elevated. The preposition <dfn>ver</dfn> has taken the final <dfn>n</dfn>, placing it before <dfn>unft</dfn>,
as it carries it constantly in its analogue <dfn>fern</dfn>, that which is distant. Likewise
one says <dfn>fernglass</dfn>, a telescope with which one sees at a distance.</p>

 In the Oriental languages רו (<dfn>rou</dfn>) indicates the visual ray, and רד (<dfn>rad</dfn>),
all movement which is determined upon a straight line. This root,
accompanied by a guttural inflection, is called <dfn>recht</dfn>, in German, and <dfn>right</dfn>
in English and Saxon. The Latins made of it <dfn>rectum</dfn>, that which is straight.
In French <dfn>rature</dfn> and <dfn>rateau</dfn>. The Teutons, taking right in a figurative sense,
have drawn from this same root, <dfn>rath</dfn>, a council, and <dfn>richter</dfn>, a judge.</p>

<dfn>inter eligere</dfn> or <dfn>elicere</dfn>, to choose, to attract to self interiorly, and by sympathy.

 It is necessary before all, to restore the language of Moses, lost, as I
have said, for more than twenty-four centuries; it must be restored with the
aid of Greek and Latin which chain it to the illusory versions; it is necessary
to go back to its original source and find its true roots: this enormous work
that I have undertaken, I have accomplished.</p>

 In the <cite>Tao-te-King</cite> of Lao-Tse, a work which has held a high reputation
among the numerous followers of this theosophist, one finds that the absolute,
universal Being which he declares can neither be named, nor defined, is triple.
“The first,” he said, “has engendered the second; the two have produced the
third; and the three have made all things. That which the mind perceives
and the eye cannot see is named <dfn>Y</dfn>, the absolute Unity, the central point;
that which the heart understands and the ear cannot hear is named <dfn>Hi</dfn>, the
universal Existence; that which the soul feels and the hand cannot touch is
named <dfn>Ouei</dfn>, the individual Existence. Seek not to penetrate the depths of
this Trinity; its incomprehensibility comes from its Unity.” “This Unity,”
adds Lao-Tse, in another passage, “is named <dfn>Tao</dfn>, the Truth; <dfn>Tao</dfn> is Life;
<dfn>Tao</dfn> is to itself both rule and model. It is so lofty that it cannot be attained;
so profound that it cannot be fathomed; so great that it contains the Universe;
when one looks on high one sees no beginning; when one follows it in its productions,
one finds in it no end.”</p>

 One of the principal dogmas of Fo-Hi is the existence of one God in
three persons, whose image is man. All his doctrine is limited to leading, by
meditation and repression of the passions, the human ternary to its perfection.
This ternary is composed, according to him, of <dfn>Ki</dfn>, <dfn>Tsing</dfn>, and <dfn>Chen</dfn>,
that is to say, of the material, animistic, and spiritual principle. It is necessary
that, being joined together, this ternary should make but One. Then
its duration will have no limit and its faculties will be indestructible. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyez</i>

 It is said that this famous table of Emerald was found in the valley
of Hebron, in a sepulchre where it was between the hands of the cadaver of
Thoth himself. Krigsmann, who assures us that this table must have read
in Phœnician and not in Greek, quotes it a little differently from what one
reads in the ordinary versions. <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyez Tabula Smaragdina</cite>,

<h3 class="p4 h3head">Transcriber’s Note</h3>

<p>Words may have multiple spelling variations or inconsistent
hyphenation in the text. These have been left unchanged unless
indicated below.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the book. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside
down, or partially printed letters, were corrected. Final stops
missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were added.
Duplicate letters at line endings or page breaks were removed. Minor
adjustments to punctuation and diacriticals were made for consistency.</p>

<p>The Golden Verses, midway through the book, were formated in the
original on facing pages, with Greek, verso, and French, recto;
translation in English was presented as footnotes. The text of the
Greek and French was consolidated as units, the English retained as
footnotes. The numbers (1) through (36) in the English footnotes
relate to the numbered sections of the discussion of the Golden Verses
that follow the poem.</p>

<p>In footnote <a href="#footnote_125">[125]</a>, accent grave over the letter c is noted within
brackets, thus: [`c]. In footnote <a href="#footnote_226">[226]</a>, the x above
the o in the third line of the poem verse in Icelandic is indicated as
[=x]o. Anchors were missing to footnotes [371], [539], and [656]; they
were added where they likely belong.</p>

<p>Corrections to Greek: <br />
ἄγχις to ἄγχιστ<br />

<p>Corrections to Phoenician/Hebrew:<br />

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
